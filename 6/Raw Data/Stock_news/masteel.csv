	PRESTAR: PRE-STAR Or Before It Turns into A STAR PERFORMING STOCK By Calvin Tan (Perth, Australia),

	 ",,"
	Hi guys, 
	I have bought & sold Masteel in Its Cyclical UPs & Cyclical DOWNs for more than a decade already. 
	Let Calvin share his experience on a Cyclical like Masteel 
	When Pm Badawi came into power he cancelled many grandoise projects of Tun Dr Mahathir & that led to an economic contraction. He said Malaysia had no money then. That led to the protest of Tun Dr. M saying that Malaysia still has money from Petronas 
	Then Pm Badawi implemented a Huge Infrar project for the 9MP (Malaysia plan) for 2006 - 2010 
	Seeing the Huge Amount of CASH Pouring into Infrar Jobs I sensed that there will be a Huge Demand for Cement & Steel 
	SO AT THAT TIME I WAS STILL A NEWBIE I BUY BOUGHT UP ALL THE CEMENT COMPANIES 
	I bought YTL CEMENT at Around RM2.20 
	Bought CIMA (Cement Industry of Malaya) at Rm2.40 
	Bought TASEK CEMENT At Rm2.90 
	Bought LAFARGE CEMENT  at 66 sen (Whoa this one people were throwing and throwing by the Millions, tens of millions being sold when I was fearfully buying at 66 sen) Lafarge later merged from 10 lots into 3 with 20 sen Cash payout (After that LAFARGE ROSE TO OVER RM10.00; if only those dumb sellers know ahead of time) 
	Later TASEK Rose to Over Rm16.00 while Ytl Cement was taken private by YTL after price has doubled & CIMA also taken private by UEM 
	  
	NOW COMING BACK TO STEEL. Steel was really trickier as there are so many many - Mycron, Melewar, AISB, Choo Bee, Lionind, CscSteel, Ann Joo (Annjoo got 2 but later merged into one), Kingsteel, Southern Steel, Prestar,  Masteel & several others 
	Ha! Only later, much later, I found out that while All Cement Companies did very well generally the same cannot be said about steel 
	Only 4 Steel Stocks Shone in the end. All Long Steel Stocks for Infrar jobs while Prestar has Wheel Barrow & GUardrail for Highways 
	The rest of my investments in flat steel went nowhere and it was a waste of time and money 
	BUT I GOT AN IMPORTANT LESSON 
	So later when Next Infrar Boom Cycle Retarts I only go for Long Steel & Prestar 
	So Far It was Chun Chun 
	  
	I bought Prestar again at 45 sen & Prestar gone up 200% in recent cycle 
	See

			Hi Guys! 
			I am now in Perth, Australia. 
			I first came to Perth about 20 years ago. 
			Then Perth was quite backward & rural. 
			Not anymore now. 
			I got caught in North Perth's Massive Traffic Jams. 
			And I   an Idea I want to share here. 
			I   the widening of Perth's Highway - leading to huge demand for more Highway Guard Rails. 
			  
			Every time a rural road expands from 2 lanes to 4 lanes there is a NEED for 4 NEW SETS of Highway Guard Rails. 
			I can SEE So FAR From PERTH That With The Ever Increasing Number of Cars, SUVs, JEEPS, Buses, Lorries in Malaysia there will be the continual expansion of Roads into New Highways - Translating Into More Needs of Highway Guard Rails- 
			  
			So HEY PRESTO! Or Rather HEY PRESTAR! 
			  
			YES! PRESTAR CAME TO MIND. 
			  
			Regards, 
			  
			Calvin, 
			Perth, Australia

								Hi Guys,  
								 
								I have An Investment Approach I which I would like to all. 
				     |     
						With the Contraction in China, the Overvaluation of Export Stocks & The Overstretched Consumers  of Malaysia Impacted by 6% GST & High Imported inflation due to weak ringgit there are really few stocks left for the picking in Bursa. 
						There remains a Class of Underperforming Stocks that might go against the trend – “THE CONSTRUCTION  MATERIAL STOCKS LIKE KPSCB, KIMLUN, CEPCO & PRESTAR”. As KPSCB, KIMLUN & CEPCO Have Already Run Up 20% to 30% In Prices Our Focus Now Turn To  PRESTAR. 
						  
						PRESTAR Or PRE-STAR 
						“PRE” As in “PREVIOUS” Or “Before” 
						Or In Other Words “Before IT TURNS INTO A STAR” 
										SO NOW IS THE TIME TO BUY PRESTAR “BEFORE IT TURNS INTO A STAR PERFORMING STOCK” 
										  
										PRESTAR – THE RISING STAR AMONG CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL STOCKS! 
										ITS SALIENT FACTORS: 
										1)  At 50 cents with NTA at Rm1.23 PRESTAR IS SELLING AT A HUGE 60% DISCOUNT TO NTA. It Has A Big Margin of Safety. 
										2) Foreward P/E is a low 3.66. Beating many Export Furniture and E & E Stocks hands down. 
										3) Its Debt is Well Cushioned By Its High Tangible Assets Still Not Revalued Yet. Its Properties were purchased long ago in strategic locations. If Company wanted to It Can Revalue All Its Properties Like HapSeng, Seacera & Eg and book them as immense profits. 
										4) Unlike All Other Steel Companies Impacted by China Steel Dumping PRESTAR Like KPSCB, KIMLUN & CEPCO Are Into Niche Manufacturing of Specialty Construction Materials like High Way Guard Rails and Wheel Barrows. So It has avoided the carnage caused by Cheap China Steel. 
										5) 10 Highways Including Pasir Gudang Highway, West Coastal Highway, Bandar Penawar – Sungai Ringgit Highway, Pengerang Highway & the 1,600 km Pan Borneo Highway will spur Great Demand for Prestar’s Highway Guardrails. 
										6) Prestar also stand to reap higher profit due to the collapse of nickel and iron ore prices by 60% to 70% as its Guard Rails use a lot of nickel. This will boost Prestar’s profits further. 
										7) Prestar also has a factory in Vietnam like Pohuat. With TPP now signed Prestar will do very well as both Vietnam & Malaysia are expected to be top beneficiaries. 
										8) PRESTAR Also Invest In The Shares of POSCO, In Which the World’s Greatest Investor, Warren Buffet of Berkshire Hathaway,  has a Share also.  Partnership in prosperity! 
										9) SEEING ITS BRIGHT FUTURE INSIDERS AND DIRECTORS HAVE BOUGHT MILLIONS OF PRESTAR SHARES ON THE QUIET. A Check with these Directors and Insiders Show That They Have Bought PRESTAR Shares As High As Rm1.00 And Now Still Buying Even More at Depressed Prices. 
										10) A 2 Cents Dividend has been proposed. That means that Prestar is giving a 4% yield. Will there be another double digit dividend like those years when INSIDERS Bought As High As Rm1.00?  It remains to be seen. 
										PRESTAR IS A STOCK WITH LIMITED DOWNSIDE WHILE ITS UPSIDE IS BRIGHT WITH THE UNFOLDING OF 10MP & 11 MASTER PLAN PROJECTS STILL BEING AWARDED. 
										  
										Calvin has a target price of Rm1.00 (The Price Reached When PM Badawi implemented 9MP). 
										From 50 cents we expect a modest 100% Upside. 
										  
										CHEERS! 
										Regards, 
										Calvin 
										{This article posted while holidaying in Australia.) 
										Note: On May 9th, 2007 PRESTAR Declared a 22% Special Dividend which equals to 11 cents. Prestar price crossed Rm1.00 then. Instead of selling Directors & Insiders were buying . As of now PRESTAR is selling at half price & Directors/Insiders are still buying. So will there be ANOTHER SPECIAL DIVIDEND? 
										  
										 
										 
										 
										 
										 
										  
										 
										  
										See Long Steel is for Structure Strengthening 
										  
										HOW IT WORKS 
										1) LONG STEEL REBARS ARE NETTED INTO RECTANGULAR SHAPES BY ROUNDING & ROPING THE WHOLE LENGTH IN PLACE 
										  
										2) NEXT PLYWOOD IS USED TO FORM BOXES ENCASING THEM 
										  
										3) FINALLY CONCRETE AGGREGATE & CEMENT POURED INTO THEM AND HARDENED 
										  
										  FOR HIGH RISE BUILDINGS, MRT & LRT PILLARS, SUPPORT FOR ROAD & RAIL BRIDGES, WALL ENBANKMENTS TO PREVENT EROSION OR LAND SLIDES 
										AND MASTEEL SUPPLIES MORE PURE REBAR AS A PURE LONG STEEL PLAYER

																Dear Friends of i3 Investor Forum, 
																Annjoo Steel has given a set of exceptional results. By arbitrage Masteel should also be doing well. As such Calvin now advocate accumulating Masteel - the laggard steel stock with the greatest potential for upside.

5098, MALAYSIA STEEL WORKS (KL) BHD SHS ," Fri, 1 Mar 2019, 11:42 AM ",PublicInvest Research Headlines - 1 Mar 2019,Economy Markets Market Update," Economic growth in the US slowed in the 4Q of 2018, according to a report released by the Commerce Department on Thursday, although the pace of growth still exceeded analyst estimates. The real gross domestic product climbed by 2.6% in the 4Q compared to the 3.4% jump in the 3Q. Economists had expected GDP to increase by 2.3%. The bigger than expected increase in GDP came as consumer spending growth slowed but continued to make a strong contribution to the economy. Consumer spending jumped by 2.8% in the 4Q after surging up by 3.5% in the 3Q. The report also showed positive contributions from non-residential fixed investment, exports, private inventory investment, and federal government spending. (RTT)  A report released by the Labor Department on Thursday showed first-time claims for US unemployment benefits rose by more than expected in the week ended February 23rd. The report said initial jobless claims climbed to 225,000, an increase of 8,000 from the previous week's revised level of 217,000. Economists had expected jobless claims to edge up to 220,000 from the 216,000 originally reported for the previous week. Meanwhile, the less volatile four-week moving average fell to 229,000, a decrease of 7,000 from the previous week's revised average of 236,000. The pullback by the four-week moving average came after it reached its highest level since Jan of 2018 in the previous week. The report also said continuing claims increased by 79,000 to 1.805m in the week ended Feb 16th. (RTT)  US officials are preparing a final trade deal that President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping could sign in weeks, people familiar with the matter said, even as a debate continues in Washington over whether to push Beijing for more concessions. The US is eyeing a summit between the two presidents as soon as mid March, said one of the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the preparations are confidential. The planning has been complicated by Xi’s need to lead China’s annual National People’s Congress in early March, as well as make other foreign trips, the people said. A White House spokesman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump will have the final call on the US side. (Bloomberg)  Germany's consumer price inflation accelerated for the first time in four months in Feb and at a faster than expected pace, preliminary data from the Federal Statistical Office showed on Thursday. The consumer price index rose 1.6% YoY following a 1.4% increase in Jan. Economists had expected 1.5% inflation. Energy inflation rose slightly to 2.9% from 2.3%. Food inflation climbed to 1.5% from 0.8%. On a MoM basis, the CPI rose 0.5% in Feb, which was in line with economists' expectations. Inflation based on the harmonized index of consumer prices was steady at 1.7% for a third month. That also matched economists' forecast. Compared to the previous month, the HICP rose 0.5% in Feb, in line with economists forecast. (RTT)  Greek retail sales by volume rose 0.7% in Dec compared to the same month in 2017 after a downwardly revised 2.9% increase in Nov, statistics service ELSTAT said on Thursday. Retail sales were led higher by apparel, footwear, fuels and supermarkets. Greece's economy expanded for a ninth straight quarter in July to Sept and at a faster pace than the previous quarter, mainly driven by stronger consumer spending. Gross domestic product grew by 1.0% in the third quarter compared to an upwardly revised 0.4% in April to June, according to the seasonally adjusted data from statistics agency ELSTAT. (RTT)  Brexit continues to take a toll on the UK, with new figures showing a fall in business confidence and continued weakness in the property market. House price-growth remained tepid in Feb, with values rising just 0.4% from a year earlier. That’s better than the 0.1% figure in Jan, but far below the pace recorded in 2018. The stress of leaving the European Union without a settled plan for future ties with the UK’s biggest trading partner is taking its toll. Prime Minister Theresa May this week conceded that exit day may need to be postponed as she tries to get her withdrawal deal through Parliament. While that uncertainty is also hitting the housing market, a shortage of homes, record employment and low interest rates are preventing a sharp downturn in prices. (Bloomberg)  Factory activity in China contracted to a 3- year low in Feb as export orders fell at the fastest pace since the global financial crisis, highlighting deepening cracks in an economy facing weak demand at home and abroad. The gloomy findings are likely to reinforce views that the world’s second-largest economy is still losing steam, after growth last year cooled to a near 30-year low. Even with increasing government stimulus to spur activity, concerns are growing that China may be at risk of a sharper slowdown if current Sino-US trade talks fail to relieve some of the pressure. The official Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to 49.2 in Feb from 49.5 in Jan, pointing to a contraction in activity for the third straight month. (Reuters)  India's economic growth slowed in the three months to Dec, figures from the statistics ministry showed on Thursday. GDP grew 6.6% YoY in the Oct to Dec quarter, after expanding 7% in the previous three months. Economists had forecast growth of around 6.9%. Growth was 8% in the April to June quarter. Weaker consumption and investments were to blame for the latest slowdown in growth. The ministry trimmed the growth estimate for the fiscal year ending March 31 to 7% from 7.2%. Economists fear India's economic growth could slow if the on-going political and military tensions with Pakistan escalate. The upcoming general election is also a crucial factor that could determine the direction of the economy. Despite the slower growth rate, India remained the fastest growing emerging economy in the Oct – Dec quarter. (RTT)  MMC Corp’s Langat Centralised Sewage Treatment Plant (Langat CSTP) is expected to receive and start treating its first sewage inflow by April this year, at an initial inflow of 112,000m³ per day. During this first phase of operation, the sewage treatment plant will go through a testing and commissioning stage that will last for about two years. (The Edge)  . Yinson Holdings has bagged contracts worth USD901.79m (RM3.67bn) for the charter, operations and maintenance of a floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel by First Exploration & Petroleum Development Company Ltd for use at the Anyala & Madu fields in Nigeria. (The Edge)  TRC Synergy civil servant housing development project in the administrative capital of Putrajaya has been axed by Perbadanan Putrajaya Corp on grounds of national interest. TRC had on Feb 25 received a three-month termination notice from Perbadanan Putrajaya concerning the project, which was for a gross development cost of RM292.74m. (The Edge)  Brahim’s Holdings (BHB) has lapsed into Practice Note 17 (PN17) status, after its shareholder equity fell below the 25% threshold. Based on the unaudited interim financial results of BHB for the 4Q ended Dec 31, 2018, the shareholders’ equity of BHB on a consolidated basis of less than RM40m represented 25% or less of its issued capital. Hence, BHB is now regarded as a PN17 company. (The Edge)  A subsidiary of Malayan United Industries (MUI) which operated the Metrojaya Department Store in BB Plaza is suing UDA Holdings for alleged premature termination of tenancy. MJ Department Stores was the anchor and largest tenant in BB Plaza for some 33 years since 1981 until January 2015. (The Edge)  Affin Bank 4Q net profit fell 15.21% to RM143.75m from RM169.54m a year ago, due to higher interest expenses coupled with lower net fee and commission income. EPS for the quarter ended Dec 31, 2018 dropped to 7.4sen from 8.92sen previously. Net interest income fell by 7.22% to RM207.53m from RM223.69m previously. (The Edge)  BIMB Holdings registered a 7.85% rise in net profit to RM161.39m or 9.53sen per share in the 4Q ended Dec 31, 2018 against RM149.64m or 9.14sen per share in the prior period last year on the back of higher contributions from its takaful and Islamic banking businesses. Revenue grew 18.51% to RM1.12bn from RM946.04m in 4QFY17. (The Edge)  Malaysia Steel Works (KL) (Masteel) posted a loss of RM24.87m in the 4Q ended Dec 31, 2018 or a loss per share of 5.84sen because of lower margins, impairment of inventories and higher administrative expenses. In the year-ago quarter, it made a net profit of RM12.12m or EPS of 4.02sen. Revenue contracted 17.4% YoY to RM348.93m from RM422.33m (The Edge) The FBM KLCI might open lower today after the S&P 500 notched up its longest losing streak of 2019 as weak economic data earlier in the day pointing to the effects of the trade war on growth took its toll on global markets. Investors continue to wait for signs of a breakthrough to end the trade impasse. Data in China showed its factory sector contracted for a third consecutive month in February with the country’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index at a three-year low. US growth data for the fourth quarter last year looked brighter, coming in at 2.6 percent, better than the 2.3 percent forecast. The S&P 500 ended 0.3% lower and fell for a third consecutive session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 69.16 points, or 0.3%, to 25,916 and the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 21.98 points, or 0.3%, to 7,532.53. Across the Atlantic, the Stoxx Europe 600 ended flat with the FTSE 100 fell 0.5% while Germany’s DAX added 0.25% and France’s CAC 40 added 0.29%. Back home, the FBM KLCI index lost 5.72 points or 0.33% to 1,707.73 points on Thursday. Trading volume increased to 2.57bn worth RM2.97bn. Market breadth was negative with 241 gainers as compared to 702 losers. In the region, Japan’s Nikkei closed down 0.8%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 0.4%. In mainland China, the Shanghai Composite closed 0.4% lower after disappointing factory-activity data, while the smaller-cap Shenzhen Composite rose about 0.3%. Source:   - 1 Mar 2019"

	Hi guys, 
	There is a very high percentage chance that the  will be restored this April 2019 when Tun Dr Mahathir visits China 
	And in view of the Important construction of a  stretching from Port Klang in Selangor on the West Coast of Malaysia to Tumpat in Kelantan at the Upper most state of Kelantan on the East Coast... All for the ONE BELT ONE ROAD initiative of China 
	  
	Calvin has picked these Cream of the Best Stocks in their field 
	And these are the reasons why I . No matter who are chosen to do the contract jobs these  
	  
	 
	Prestar is selling guardrails and sturdy wheel barrows 
	At 600 Kilometer long there will lots of guardrails needed 
	As of now one guardrail about 10 feet to 12 feet long is priced at Rm217 per piece. 
	About 4 meter a piece 
	600,000/4 x Rm217 = Rm31, 950,000. And for 2 sides = 
	Right Now another longer highway is under construction 
	THE PAN BORNEO HIGHWAY 
	See 
	 
	  
	Notice the shining guardrail? They are alloys of steel & nickel 
	The length of the entire highway is expected to be about   (1,294 mi) for the Malaysian section, 168 kilometres (104 mi) for the Bruneian section and 3,073 kilometres (1,909 mi) for the Indonesian section.  The   sections of the Pan Borneo Highway is known as the Trans-Kalimantan Highway. 
	 
	No wonder Prestar Insiders are buying & buying 
	  
	  
	  
	 
	Long steel is needed to build Bridges & retaining walls all along the highways 
	Since Masteel is a pure Long Steel Players it will benefit Most from Highways, MRT, LRT & in 2 more years the High Speed Rail 
	So ECRL will spur lots of demand 
	Since the ECRL ends near Kapar, Port Klang  over others like LionInd, SSteel & Annjoo 
	  
	 Malaysia Steel Works (KL) Bhd factories are located strategically at Petaling Jaya and   in the state of Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia. 
	The Bukit Raja factory produces steel bars and steel billets which are the feed stock for its rolling mills in Petaling Jaya and Bukit Raja. Both the manufacturing plants are equipped with modern equipment and are fully computerised to produce precision quality products from both the mills. 
	The principal activities of Masteel is in the manufacturing and marketing of high tensile steel bars, mild steel bars and prime steel billets. Masteel has a wide network of customers domestically as well as internationally. 
	The finished products manufactured by Masteel conforms to those required by SIRIM (MS 146:2014), ACRS (Australia) as well as the ISO 9001 standards. 
	BEING NEAR IS IMPORTANT FOR COST & TIME SAVING 
	 
	Now don't be silly and go buy flat steel or Pm Metal which is doing aluminium 
	 
	INSIDERS ALSO BOUGHT MASTEEL  SHARES & AT VERY HIGH PRICES STILL HOLDING 
	  
	AND EVEN AFTER BONUS ISSUES THEIR COST OF PURCHASE STILL QUITE HIGH 
	  
	 
	When PM Badawi implemented 9 MP I bought Lafarge at 66 sen & Tasek at Rm2.90 
	Then I think there was a capital exercise where Lafarge went from 10 to 3 share consolidation. So lafarge at year 2006 price of 66 sen is actually now around Rm2.00 
	Lafarge gone up over Rm10.00 in its cyclical up. Now fallen due to cancellation of so many projects 
	 
	Like Prestar -- Lafarge also got a Cement Manufacting Plant in Rawang (only 6 km to Serendah) to which ECRL will pass 
	 
	  
	  
	 
	You heard of steel dumping from China. But  don't hear about Cement dumping from China? Why? 
	The answer is - Cement cannot last long - only 2 months or 3 months before hardening. If Cement is exposed to water or sea water it will quickly harden & be of no use. 
	So Cement is a fragile commodity. Especially for the Cement Aggregate carried by  
	Once the fresh batch of cement leaves a Cement Plant - 
	 
	OR ELSE DUE TO QUALITY CONTROL IT WILL BE REJECTED 
	 
	Tasek Cement, unfortunately, has its cement plant in  Perak. So it is less ideal. 
	And all along the length of the highways at certain spots they will build Cement Batching Plants 
	  
	No wonder it went limit up yesterday. And will go up some more when ECRL is signed 
	Lafarge share holders are also starting to buy 
	  
	  
	  
	BEST REGARDS 
	Calvin Tan 
	  
	Please do your utmost diligence before buying or selling 
	  
	STOP PRESS!!

			In the period of 10 years, you can clearly see that Annjoo's share price didn't go anywhere other than oscillating between the range 0.63-4.06. As point 1 rightfully states, cyclicals expand and contract, then expand and contract again. 
						7.05% 
	 
	With all the above, I'm convinced to say that the prime time of steel stocks was over, the easy money has been made in the last cycle, steel stocks are currently into their downtrends. I'm not saying you cannot make money until the next big trend reversal, it's just that: 
	1. When buying cyclical stocks in uptrends, it's easy to make money. 
	2. On the other hand, when buying cyclical stocks in downtrends, it depends on how skilled you are in predicting ephemeral rebounds. I reckon that's not my game.

5098, MALAYSIA STEEL WORKS (KL) BHD SHS ," Fri, 4 May 2018, 9:16 AM ",Malaysia Steel Works (KL) Bhd - Negatives priced in; Pending downtrend line breakout,,"Values emerged after share prices tumbled 44% from 52-wk high to RM0.78, as MASTEEL is only trading at 0.38x P/BV (64% below its peers) and 4.4x FY17 P/E (31% below its peers and 46% below 10Y average). Management is cautiously optimistic of a good FY18, leveraging of a firm steel prices (average RM2700/MT in 1Q18/RM2678 YTD vs 4Q17 of RM2490) as well as expecting accelerated pick up in demand from up-and-coming mega infrastructure projects.  MASTEEL is one of the biggest long steel manufacturers in Malaysia, producing steel billets and steel bars. The manufacturing facilities are located in Petaling Jaya and Bukit Raja, Klang with an annual capacity of 700k MT billets and 750k MT steel bars, respectively. It has over 60 domestic dealers and several international trading houses as partners in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines . Besides, MASTEEL’s associate company which manufactures radioisotopes for the imaging of cancer cells had seen firm growth in revenue (FY17: ~RM4.6m vs FY14: ~RM1.4m). Its radioisotopes manufacturing facility is located in Bandar Enstek, Negeri Sembilan, supplying mainly to the hospitals throughout Peninsular Malaysia.  Masteel is optimistic of a good FY18, leveraging of a firm steel prices (average RM2700/MT in 1Q18/RM2678 YTD vs 4Q17 of RM2490) as well as in anticipation of an accelerated pick-up in demand from up-and-coming mega infrastructure projects. Overall, steel prices are likely to remain strong on the back of: i) Malaysia’s government safeguard duties and (ii) firm China steel prices as ongoing capacity cutting measure to reduce 150m MT of steel production capacity by 2020 amid the continuing of anti pollution campaign.  The steel tariff of 25% announced by Donald Trump’s administration in early 2018 is not expected to have a substantial impact on MASTEEL as it does not export to the US. The risk of the excess quantities, due to the above implementation, being offloaded at low prices in Malaysia’s market is low due to existing import duty of 5% and the additional safeguard tariff of 13.4%. The continuation of the safeguard duties until 2020 may stabilise earnings performance for the next few years.  On the domestic front, the China-owned steel mill in the east coast is expected to commence production in 2H18. As substantial amounts of their production output are slated for export, management views that the remaining quantities are expected to be well absorbed by the local market, given the accelerated roll-out of various mega infrastructure/construction projects such as MRT3, LRT3, ECRL and HSR.  With the installation and operation of the new equipment in 2018, MASTEEL will be able to increase its production of steel billets by 50,000 MT in 2018 and 100,000 MT in subsequent years. The anticipated improvement in the output will generate additional revenue of approximately RM100m, equivalent to an increase of 7% in revenue for the years ahead.  At RM0.78, MASTEEL is trading at 0.38x P/BV (64% below its peers) and 4.4x FY17 P/E (31% below its peers and 46% below 10Y average), respectively. After plunging about 50% from 52-week high of RM1.40 to a low of RM0.705, share prices staged a relief rally to end at RM0.78 yesterday, in tandem with a rebound in international steel prices and in anticipation of gradual pick-up in infrastructure projects. A decisive breakout above downtrend line resistance near RM0.805 will lift prices higher towards RM0.87 (23.6% FR) before reaching our LT objective at RM0.97 (38.2% FR and 200d SMA). Key supports are situated near RM0.74 (daily Bollinger band) and RM0.71 (100w SMA). Cut loss at RM0.705. Source:   - 4 May 2018"

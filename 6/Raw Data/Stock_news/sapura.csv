		 目标价：0.34令吉 
		最新进展： 
		沙布拉能源（SAPNRG，5218 ，主板能源股）获颁5张合约，总计高达约12亿7900万令吉，主要都是钻探及工程与建筑（E&C）相关合约。 
		截至今年3月底，该公司获得的合约总值约为185亿令吉；去年同期则为172亿令吉。 
		这些合约都将在本财年开始贡献公司盈利。 
		行家建议： 
		上述获颁的合约价值，仍符合我们的预期，因此目前维持2020及2021财年的盈利预测。 
		钻探业务仍未收支平衡，加上工程与建筑业务赚幅目前正遭遇萎缩，且随着近来脱售上游业务50%持股，勘探与生产（E&P）业务贡献显著减少。 
		因此，我们对沙布拉能源盈利前景仍保持警惕，相信短期内将持续疲软。 
		虽然如此，该公司获得新订单、减低债务节省利息，加上工程与建筑及钻探业务将逐渐恢复元气，相信2020财年次季（5至7月）开始，营业额将可显著增长。 
		目前维持财测不变，将在钻探业务收支平衡、工程与建筑业务赚幅改善，及营运开销管理改善后，重估该股。

The Group also secured two contracts for its drilling segment. These contracts are undoubtedly positive as they ensure earnings visibility for the next three years and help to improve its fabrication yard utilization. This marks the first set of contract wins for FY20, with more expected to come in the ensuing months. Our order book replenishment target is RM7bn. We believe this is achievable given its successful track record in CY18 where a total of RM9.3bn worth of contracts were clinched against our initial order book assumption of RM6bn. Tenderbook remains strong at c. RM45.1bn. These new contracts have pushed its balance in hand to more than RM20bn.

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Mon, 15 Apr 2019, 2:29 PM ",Sapura Energy - First Slew of Contracts for FY20,INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS Drilling.,"Secured contracts worth RM1.3b. Sapura Energy Bhd’s (SEB) announced that it has secured several contracts and contract extensions worth approximately RM1.3b. The contracts secured are for its drilling as well as; engineering and construction (E&C) segments which brings its total contract wins for the current FY to roughly RM18.5b (from RM17.2b as of March 2019). The details of the contracts are as follows: The segment managed to secure one (1) extension of its existing contract with PETRONAS Carigali and one (1) new drilling contract in Malaysia.  We are maintaining both our FY20-21F earnings forecasts at this juncture as the new contract wins are within our orderbook replenishment assumption. That said, we are expecting more meaningful earnings to be recognized starting this FY due to the recent contract wins and pick-up in activity levels for both its E&C and drilling segment which is slated to begin from FY20 onwards.  Despite the crude oil price currently in an upward trend breaching the USD70pb level, we remain wary on Sapura Energy’s earnings prospect as we foresee that its profitability will remain weak in the near term. The expected weak earnings prospect is mainly due to its drilling segment which is currently struggling to remain afloat and has yet to break-even as of 4QFY19. This, we opine is further exacerbated by the margin compression currently experienced by its E&C segment. Furthermore, with the recent sale of 50% stake in Sapura Upstream, contribution from its Exploration & Production (E&P) segment has now been reduced significantly. That said, we remain positive on SEB’s increasing orderbook replenishments; interest savings from paring down its borrowings as well as; the expected pick-up in activity levels for both its E&C and drilling segments. Furthermore, we are expecting to see a ramp-up in its activity levels as early as 1QCY19 as EPCIC contract works begin and yard utilisation will increase to 40% in 4QFY19 (from 10% currently) with more meaningful revenue recognition expected from 2QFY20 onwards. Yard utilisation is also expected to gradually increase to 80% with more works undertaken in the next six months. As such, we are reiterating our Neutral call on Sapura Energy with an unchanged TP of RM0.34 per share. Key rerating catalyst for Sapura Energy would be: (i) break-even of its drilling segment; (ii) improved margin for E&C segment as well as; (iii) better management of OPEX. Source:   - 15 Apr 2019"
5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Mon, 15 Apr 2019, 2:25 PM ",Sapura Energy Berhad - New Contract Wins of RM1.3b,,"Last week, SAPNRG announced its first new contract wins for the financial year, amounting to RM1.3b. The new wins include: (i) two local drilling contracts, and (ii) three engineering and construction (E&C) contracts from overseas (refer to table below for more detailed breakdown of contracts awarded). We are positive on the new contract wins, highlighting the company’s competitiveness and job winning abilities. In fact, its subsea pipelines installation contract in the Gulf of Suez represents the company’s first foray into Egypt, while its first contract from The Royal Australian Navy – a Submarine Rescue Service Contract to design and fabricate a remotely operated vehicle, underlined the company’s technological and engineering competencies. Overall, these new wins are expected to lift the company’s order-book to a three-year high of ~RM18b, although its drilling utilisation would remain unchanged at around 6 out of 16 rigs from end-FY19 (with another additional one rig scheduled to commence in 2Q FY20) as the new drilling contracts are for rigs already utilised currently (i.e. extension / replacement contracts) Having completed its recapitalisation exercise, we believe the worst should be over for SAPNRG, underpinned by its cleaned-up balance-sheet (net-gearing of 0.6x), three-year high secured order-book (~RM18b), and job execution competencies. Moving forward, with its tender-book of ~USD11b, more than half of which is from the Middle-east and Africa, we expect more contract wins to continue throughout the year. Post-contract awards, we made no changes to our FY20-21E numbers as the new wins are still within our order-book replenishment assumption of RM5b (versus FY19A wins of RM9.3b). We are forecasting a turnaround in FY20, especially in the 2H of the year, driven by: (i) interest costs savings from borrowings repayment following its recapitalisation, (ii) lower depreciation costs following impairments of RM1.5b in FY19, and (iii) several fabrication jobs load-out in the 2Q-3Q. , with an   RM0.43, pegged to 0.5x PBV. SAPNRG is our tactical top-pick for the quarter within the oil and gas sector, being a laggard play with limited downside, as well as capitalising on its turnaround story. Further catalysts may come from successful earnings delivery as well as further contract wins. (i) poorer-than-expected margins, (ii) lowerthan-expected order-book replenishment, (iii) failures in job executions. Source:   - 15 Apr 2019"

Our  from 14.2%/3.4% (recall that the growth in FY19E is due to low base number in FY18A). In line with our minor earnings and target price upgrades post recent corporate results, we have further  (from 1,735 previously), representing FY19E/FY20E PERs of 18.5x/17.5x. The absence of re-rating catalysts is capping the market upside and has also clamped the investment sentiment. Based on market data, there are more “cons” than “pros”. For instance, the FBMKLCI is still relatively richer in valuation vis-à-vis its regional peers, especially the North-Eastern region. As such, we do not rule out continuous foreign outflows, especially after MSCI recently increased the weighting of China A shares. Moreover, buying momentum remains uninspiring in general as per our Volume-Price study. The FBMKLCI is expected to chart a potential turning point (or a bottom in this case) between Dec-18 and Sep-19 before seeing a potential upswing that could lead to new highs between Oct-20 and Aug-21. The FBMKLCI Cycle Study is also reinforced by the long-term Cycle Study of S&P 500. The U.S. equity market could still be far from its best and worst days as the projected major peak and trough are only expected in 4Q21 and 3Q23, respectively. As such, the U.S. equity market is believed to be still in its secular bull run and there is still a long way to go before meaningful corrections start to set in. Therefore, in the absence of any major external shocks, we have a higher chance of seeing the local equity market unfolding its potential upcycle. We only have one OVERWEIGHT call on Gaming sector, as we have downgraded Aviation and Utilities sectors to NEUTRAL from OVERWEIGHT post the recent results season. At the same time, as we have also ungraded Gloves and Plastic Packaging sectors from UNDERWEIGHT to NEUTRAL, leaving only two (2) sectors labelled as UNDERWEIGHT at the moment. The others are rated NEUTRAL. . In this quarter, we will focus on: (i) laggards, (ii) defensive and high-yield counters, and (iii) potential beneficiaries of interest rate cut. Other than that, we also emphasis on Auto sector as we have seen more upgrades thus far due to expectations of better numbers as well as attractive valuations. In view of the stronger Brent crude oil prices, we have also been searching for laggards within the sector. Last but not least, with the bullish cycle study, we also believe BURSA is well positioned to capitalise on this potential bull run. Source:   - 2 Apr 2019"

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Tue, 26 Mar 2019, 5:12 PM ","Sapura Energy (HOLD, Maintain) - Early-phase E&C Dragging Down Profit",Results Missed Expectations – Final Kitchen-sinking? Near-term Catalyst Depends on the Yard Ramp-up Maintain HOLD Risks to Call,"SAPE’s 4QFY19 results missed expectations, due mainly to a weak engineering and construction (E&C) performance, as projects were still at an early stage of execution. While SAPE’s financial condition has improved (net gearing of 0.64x vs. 1.73x as of 3QFY19) with the recent rights issue and completion of divestment, its projects are still ramping up slowly with recovery expected only towards 2H once projects commence on the construction phase. The drilling segment will likely be a drag with no near-term immediate catalyst. No changes to our SOTP-based  of  and  rating. SAPE booked in a long list of one-offs which consist of: i) PPE impairment of RM1.4bn (drilling rig: RM1bn, marine assets: RM394m), ii) goodwill impairment of RM108m related to the subsea business and an Australia operation, iii) provision of bad debt for one of its E&C projects amounting to RM176m, iv) ESOS expenses of RM61m, and v) RM80m unrealised forex loss. After excluding these and adding back the Energy profit of RM66.8m for comparison purposes, core losses came in at RM276m. This missed our and consensus expectations, due to poorer-than-expected E&C margins. The activities of Lumut yard is expected to ramp up to 29,000 tonnes in 2019 vis-à-vis a low of 5,000 tonnes in 2018, mainly driven by Pegaga and ONGC’s 98/2 Central Processing Platform (CPP) projects, and the Gorek, Larak-Bakong wellhead platforms. The work visibility is expected to be sustained into FY2021 at 38,000 tonnes as a result of accelerated Pegaga CPP work progress. SAPE has been aggressive in securing new jobs (FY19: RM9.3bn), resulting in an increase in its order book size to RM17.2bn (FY18: RM14.9bn). We lower our 2020-21 earnings forecasts to reflect the changes in earnings recognition for its Energy segment going forward (from consolidated method to equity accounting) and cut our margin assumptions to factor in the likely delay in recovery to 2HFY20. We forecast a decline in FY22E earnings as the Brazil PLSV firm contracts will expire, and SAPE is likely to renew or secure new clients at lower rates. We maintain our HOLD rating with an unchanged target price of RM0.35 as we expect a couple more quarters of muted numbers before a recovery. Key upside risks include: (i) higher-than-expected contract wins, (ii) better rig utilisation rates, and (iii) further strengthening in global oil prices. Key downside risks include: (i) decrease in global oil prices, (ii) delay in existing work orders, and (iii) weaker drilling rigs utilisation Source:   - 26 Mar 2019"

	这集团持续经营收入为14.851亿令吉，比去年同期（“Q4FY2018”）的9.027亿令吉高64.5％，主要是由于工程及建筑业务收入增加所致。 
	在本季度，这集团持续经营的税前亏损及减值之后的亏损为21.977亿令吉，而相比二零一八年财政年度第四季税前亏损及减值之后的亏损23亿930万令吉减少4.8％。在已终止经营业务减值后，本季度税前利润包括出售子公司50％股权的收益，即26.637亿令吉。

	该部门录得收入12.6亿令吉，较二零一八年财政年度第四季的收入6亿7030万令吉增加88.0％，与本季度的较高活动一致。 
	钻井： 
	由于与Q4 FY2018相比，工作钻机数量增加，本季度的2.5亿令吉的收入比Q4 FY2018的2.304亿令吉收入高出8.5％。在扣除了减值亏损后，该部门税前亏损为10.924亿令吉，较Q4 FY2018的税前亏损21.145亿令吉减少48.3％。

	勘探和生产： 
	该部门录得收入9.36亿令吉，较去年同期的8.444亿令吉收入增加10.9％。增加的原因是本年度较高的liftings以及较高的平均实现油气价格的影响。 
	该部门于本年度录得除税前溢利8,860万令吉，较去年同期的6440万令吉高出2420万令吉，与收入增加一致。本年度的税前利润包括出售子公司50％股权的收益，即26.637亿令吉。

	这集团来自持续经营业务的收入为14.851亿令吉，较上一季度（Q3FY2019）的12.061亿令吉增加23.1％，主要由于工程及建筑业务部门的收入增加。本季度已终止经营业务的税后利润包括出售子公司50％股权的收益，即26.637亿令吉。 
	前景： 
	于二零一九年财政年度，这集团成功实施其战略计划，以完成附加股及与OMV就其E＆P业务的战略合作关系，以加强其财务状况。通过这两项活动，这集团筹集约76亿令吉以偿还其借款及作为营运资金。因此，这集团已进行去杠杆化，并将自身定位于更强大的财务基础，以利用改善中市场的新兴机会。 
	未来，减值准备将使这集团在经营和财务上更具竞争力。这集团目前的172亿令吉订单达到两年来的最高水平，并随着集团在全球范围内竞标更大，更高价值的项目而继续增长。FY2019累计新合同的价值达到93亿令吉，其核心市场获得了值得注意的EPCIC项目，包括Mubalada石油公司的Pegaga天然气开发项目，ONGC的KG-DWN 98/2 NELP区块以及在墨西哥湾的Hokchi Field Development。该集团在其增长战略中有了重要的里程碑，即在中东和非洲有新的项目。作为沙特阿美公司长期协议（“LTA”）计划下的八家合格服务公司之一，将开辟新的工程，采购，施工和安装机会，并加深其在中东的业务。最近得到由壳牌石油公司在尼日利亚管理的一个管道项目以及与雪佛龙公司在安哥拉签订的长期钻井合同，使他们在非洲的市场得到进一步加强。 
	于二零二零年财政年度，这集团将继续专注于发展及执行订单，并提供强劲的营运表现。这集团正积极寻求中东，非洲，亚太，欧洲，里海及美洲的新机遇。预计不断扩大的订单将进一步提升资产利用率，从而有助于改善财务业绩。随着活动的增加，资产负债表的增强以及潜在的增长前景令人鼓舞，董事会有信心这集团有能力发展并增加股东价值。

Cumulatively, the Group’s core net loss of RM654.8m for full-year FY19 was larger than our and consensus’ projection of a loss of RM498.5m and RM364.7m respectively. The weak performance was mainly attributed to lower recognition from the E&C and drilling segments as a result of higher cost incurred as most of the E&C projects are still in the initial procurement phase as well as low utilization of assets. Operational numbers remained positive nonetheless, with EBITDA of RM877m and margins at 15.9% for FY19. While trusting that the Group is currently in positive transition toward improving its numbers, we reckon the recovery process is likely to be slower-than-expected and hence, we cut our earnings forecasts by an average of 67% for FY20/21.

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Tue, 26 Mar 2019, 9:13 AM ",Sapura Energy Berhad - 4Q19 - A Kitchen Sinking Quarter,,"Despite reporting headline earnings returning to the black, FY19 results actually came in with core loss of RM935.9m, arrived at after stripping off impairments and gains on disposals - greatly missing our and consensus losses forecasts of RM398.2m and RM399.3m, respectively. The huge disparity was mainly due to large losses from its E&C segment in 4Q19. However, special dividend of 0.5 sen was a positive surprise. As mentioned, the widened core losses in 4Q19, both QoQ & YoY, were caused by huge losses in its E&C segment. We gathered that the E&C core operational losses were due to provisions made during the quarter, arising from issues such as project delays and costs overruns, estimated to be ~RM170m. Without the provisions, the segment would have posted about core breakeven, or incur slight core losses during the quarter. Similarly, for YTD, widened losses were also due to poorer E&C segment. Noteworthy to mention is that despite its net-gearing improving to 0.6x, from 1.7x in the previous quarter, due to funds raised from its restructuring exercise, its total borrowings still remain somewhat relatively unchanged at RM17b. Hence, finance costs savings have still yet to be captured during the quarter. That said, we expect the gazetted borrowings will be repaid by end-1Q20. Overall, we see 4Q19 as a kitchen sinking quarter, with the company taking the opportunity to further book in impairments as well as provisions. Having recently concluded its corporate exercises (entailing rights issue and 50%-stake sale of its E&P arm), we see a post-restructuring SAPNRG as a potential prime beneficiary of upstream oil and gas activities both locally and globally, underpinned by its 2-year high order-book of RM17.2b. Meanwhile, anticipating a stronger 2H20, we believe FY20 core earnings should return to the black, driven by: (i) interest savings, (ii) depreciation savings from the RM1.5b impairments made during the quarter, and (iii) profit recognition from its order-book, with jobs load-out mostly occurring in 2Q-3Q20. as we see limited downside from here given its improving outlook. We gathered that bank underwriters of the rights issue should have already cleared their stake, and hence we see little trading sentiment overhang from here. Meanwhile, post-results, we conservatively slash our FY20E earnings by 80%, after (i) adjusting finance costs assumptions given its borrowings payments schedule, while also (ii) massively realigning our E&C order-book recognition and margins assumption. However, given its improving prospects and expected turnaround in FY20, we value the company at a higher TP of RM0.43, pegged to 0.5x PBV on FY21E (raised from previously RM0.34, pegged to 0.4x PBV on FY20E). We feel our ascribed valuations to be justified, seeing limited downside, backed by our ROE study, given its FY20E ROE of 1.3%. Our valuation is also in-line with its fabrication peer MHB, trading at similar 0.5x PBV. (i) poorer-than-expected margins, (ii) lowerthan-expected order-book replenishment, and (iii) failures in job executions. Source:   - 26 Mar 2019"

	（吉隆坡18日讯 ）由于2018財政年业绩（去年12月31日结帐）大放异彩，促使达洋企业（DAYANG，5141，主板能源股）股价在过去1个月水涨船高，劲飆115%。惟分析员认为，达洋企业2019財政年將难以重现去年表现，加上股价一轮涨势之后已大幅走高，所以，建议趁高套利。 
	达洋企业股价周一应声下挫，全天跌9仙或5.26%，至1.62令吉，成交量为5629万股，是全场第10大热门股及第14大下跌股。 
	肯纳格投行分析员指出，儘管面对季节性疲软的不利因素，达洋企业在2月底出炉的2018財政年末季（截至去年12月31日）业绩仍大放异彩， 不仅顺利转亏为盈，净利比2018財政年第3季（季节性强劲需求）还高出1倍，佔全年净利的57%。 
	这导致达洋企业股价在2月22日公佈业绩后被追高。该股从业绩出炉当天的79.5仙，至3月15日的1.71令吉，狂涨115%。 
	不过， 分析员对达洋企业2019財政年的表现有所保留，因为2018財政年业绩大好须归功于维护业务的多项一次性订单。 
	据悉，这些一次性订单主要是客户有特定或紧急的工程，並非长期的维护工作，或订单有所更动。 
	分析员称， 「虽然达洋企业在未来也许仍会接获一次性订单，但相信不会达到2018財政年末季的高水平。 
	我们预计，该公司2019財政年首季（截至3月31日止）净利將因季节性疲弱因素而减低。」 
	 
	另一边厢， 在国家银行企业债务重组委员会的协助下，达洋企业持股60.5%的柏达纳石油（PERDANA，7108，主板能源股）將在未来12个月內完成企业重组活动，包括延长还债期限、脱售资產、发售特別股或私下配售活动，及发售附加股活动。 
	柏达纳石油也可能需要进一步做出资產减值。 
	以沙布拉能源（SAPNRG，5218，主板能源股）及VELESTO能源（VELESTO，5243，主板能源股）为例，柏达纳石油的企业重组计划將会打击股票交易情绪及走势，目標价为1.20令吉。"

	  We maintain our “hold” call on Sapura Energy (Sapura) with unchanged forecasts and FV of 30 sen per share, based on a 60% discount to our estimated diluted book value of 72 sen per share, following the completion of its RM4 billion rights issue. 
	  
	Upstream reported that Petronas is expected to delay or even abort its Kasawari project on Block SK 316 off Sarawak due to Sarawak attempting to extract additional financial benefits from the federal government. 
	In 2Q18, Petronas invited Malaysia Marine & Heavy Engineering Holdings and Sapura to bid for the engineering, procurement, construction, installation and commissioning contract for Kasawari’s Central Processing Platform. 
	Consultant Wood Mackenzie had earlier expected that Petronas could reach final investment decision on Kasawari in mid-2020 with production commencing in mid-2025. 
	With an estimated three trillion cu ft of recoverable gas reserves albeit with high carbon dioxide content between 30% and 40%, the Kasawari field is located in an environmentally sensitive marine area. The SK 316 block also contains the producing NC3 field that supplies feedstock gas to Train 9 at Petronas’ LNG complex at Bintulu and includes over five other gas discoveries which are under development and likely to start in 2022. 
	Malaysia’s near-term oil and gas order rollouts are likely to be unexciting, given the current volatility in oil price trajectory amid competition in Sabah and Sarawak for higher financial compensation for production fields within their territories. 
	Hence, brighter order prospects currently stems from overseas, principally in the Middle-East, Brazil, Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. 
	Selected as one of Saudi Aramco’s four new long-term agreement programme contractors late last year, substantive order book expansions are still likely from Sapura’s current tender book of US$8.5 billion (RM34.59 billion) and prospective bids of US$14.3 billion. 
	This is highlighted in Sapura’s new orders worth RM9.3 billion for financial year 2019 (FY19) to date, which translate into 2.3 times the RM2.8 billion jobs clinched in FY18 and an outstanding order book of RM17.7 billion — three times FY20F revenues. 
	Together with the completion of the sale of a 50% equity stake in Sapura Upstream to Austria-based OMV Aktiengesellschaft for an enterprise value of US$1.6 billion, we expect Sapura’s net profit to surge by 2.2 times for FY20F and 46% for FY21F from substantive cuts in interest costs, partly offset by the upstream earnings deconsolidation. 
	Additionally, this will cut the group’s FY20F net gearing from 1.7 times to a comfortable 0.5 times. 
	Notwithstanding its improving earnings outlook, the stock currently trades at ex price to book value of 0.4 times due to medium-term concerns over its undersubscribed rights share overhang. — AmInvestment Bank, Feb 7"

	Hi guys, 
	This is a Special Year for Malaysia's Oil & Gas Stocks as PETRONAS IS RAMPING UP OIL PRODUCTION & OPTIMISING OIL EXTRACTION TO GET THAT EXTRA 54.7 MILLION BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL FOR PENGERANG REINERY IN RAPID 
	How do we know? 
	Let's SEE SOME EVIDENCES 
	  
	As early as Jan 2018 Petronas has awarded fresh projects for these 5 OGSE 
	 
	  Engineering Services,   Enterprise,  Primera, , Fabrication and its joint venture partner Borneo Seaoffshore Engineering were selected for the five-year contract with an option to extend an additional year which took effect in September last year, Petronas said on Tuesday. 
	Under the terms of the contract, the engineering and maintenance services will include topside major maintenance (TMM) and facilities improvement projects (FIP). 
	Petronas Vice President of Malaysia Assets & Chief Executive Officer of Petronas Carigali,  , said new requirements were introduced to encourage collaboration across the industry supply chain. 
	“These contracts encompass requirements such as the utilization of marine vessels from Malaysia-owned companies only and the 
	  
	So these 5 were selected 
	1) Carimin 
	2) Dayang 
	3) Deleum 
	4) Petra Resources (Penergy) 
	5) Sapura (Sapnrg) 
	  
	With the Completion of RAPID and the rebounding of Crude Oil to USD65 per barrel PETRONAS is ramping up more Job Awards 
	  
	  
				The new year brought some good news 
				for Malaysian oil and gas (O&G) companies with Petroliam Nasional 
				(Petronas) 
				 
				  
				The national oil company said in its Petronas Activity Outlook 2018-2020 there would be about  and out of this, all the greenfield projects will have completely new facilities developed while 
				  
				In terms of segment prospects,  
				With about 100 awarded contract areas operated by 26 petroleum arrangement contractors, led mainly by the national company's E&P arm Petronas Carigali, which operates 60% of total Malaysian assets 
				There was however also a warning that closer cost control and austerity is here to stay. The report emphasized that Petronas will continue to promote and enhance transparency in the O&G industry to ensure players are equipped with more information that can assist them with better resources as well as budget planning. 
				Petronas president and ceo Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin said in response to the 'Lower for Longer' oil price environment, issues such as cost compression and industry collaborations are now a top priority. 
				""This drives a rallying call for everyone in the ecosystem to build a robust, globally competitive Malaysian Oil and Gas Services and Equipment (OGSE) industry that will sustain the market turbulence and emerge stronger,"" he said. 
				With an average production of 1.7m barrels a day forecasted over the next five years,  while maximising ultimate recovery of brownfield projects, he concluded. 
	PETRONAS GIVING OUT 
	 
	Brown means matured old Oil Field & Old Oil Platform that need a lot of refurbishing 
	PENERGY has mostly brown field. Its latest quarter showed a jumped in 61% revenue. Indicating very feverish work 
	 
	These are Totally new area starting on a clean slate. So lots of New Equipments are needed by import or fabrication 
	This wil give lots of profits to all OGSE Players 
	In a time when there is fear of trade war & recession this single Act of Petronas in giving out so many JOb Awards will be good for Malaysian OGSE and supporting industries 
	Let's search further 
	  
	The above news was in January 
	See 6 months later on July 2018 
	As RAPID IS IN FINAL COMPLETION PETRONAS AGAIN EXPANDED FROM 5 OGSE PLAYERS TO 12

	6. Sapura Energy 
	9. Velesto (Umw OG) 
	10. Deleum 
	12. Petra Resorces  
	  
	  
	Note: 
	 
	 
	 
	  
	Let's look at the Oil Production in Malaysia currently 
	Malaysia crude oil production was 661 & 675 barrels for 2017 & 2018

	73 billion cunic meter (Malaysia is Top No. 12 in the World for Natural Gas Production 
	  
	NOW ADD ANOTHER 54.7 MILLION EXTRA BARREL OF CRUDE OIL NEEDED FOR PETRONAS RAPID 
	HOW BIG IS THE PIE FOR ALL OGSE PLAYERS (BOTH UPSTREAM & DOWN STREAM: BOTH OFF SHORE AND ON SHORE) 
	  
	Just take only the Extra 54.7 Million barrel oils needed 
	  
	  
	If Oil Price is USD67  then 67 x 4.00 = Rm268 per barrel 
	54.7 millions then x 268 =

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Sat, 23 Feb 2019, 12:55 PM ",Sapura Energy deems RM4b cash call a ‘success’,,"
	KUALA LUMPUR: Sapura Energy Bhd has “successfully” raised about RM4 billion from its rights issue that closed on Jan 16, though the rights issue of new ordinary shares sweetened by free warrants under the exercise was undersubscribed. 
	The cash call also involved a rights issue of Islamic redeemable convertible preference shares (RCPS-i). 
	While the first portion to raise about RM3 billion registered a subscription rate of 81.5% — which means an undersubscription of 18.51% — the preference shares to raise some RM1 billion was oversubscribed by 1.18%. 
	In a statement, Sapura Energy said the remaining unsubscribed rights shares will be fully taken up by the joint underwriters, namely Maybank Investment Bank Bhd (Maybank IB), CIMB Investment Bank Bhd and RHB Investment Bank Bhd. 
	The three investment banks previously inked an agreement with Sapura Energy to underwrite up to 2.5 billion rights shares that could cost as much as RM750 million. Based on the 30-sen apiece issue price for the rights shares, the underwriters will have to fork out about RM555 million for the unsubscribed shares. 
	This is based on the 8.14 billion valid acceptances Sapura Energy received for its rights shares for the 9.99 billion rights shares available for subscription. The rights shares will be issued on the basis of five rights shares for every three shares held, with one free warrant given for every 10 rights shares subscribed. 
	In the weeks leading to the close of the rights issue, Sapura Energy’s share price sank numerous times below the 30 sen apiece issue price for its rights shares, sparking concerns about the cash call and the heightening underwriting risks for the three investment banks. 
	Yesterday, the stock settled at 28 sen after retreating another 0.5 sen, which gave it a market value of RM1.68 billion. Since the massive cash call was announced on Aug 24 last year, Sapura Energy’s share price has declined near 32% from when it was trading at 41 sen. 
	As for the RCPS-i, the group received valid acceptances and excess applications of 2.43 billion for the 2.11 billion RCPS-i available for subscription. The preference shares will be issued at 41 sen each, on the basis of two RCPS-i for every five shares held. 
	On completion of the cash call, Sapura Energy said Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB) had emerged as its single largest shareholder with a 40% stake. Sapura Technology Sdn Bhd — which is controlled by president and chief executive officer Tan Sri Shahril Shamsuddin — is now its second largest shareholder with a 16.3% stake after Shahril raised his commitment by RM100 million from RM300 million initially. 
	PNB, which has been supportive of the cash call, committed RM2.68 billion to the entire exercise after giving an undertaking to subscribe for some of the unsubscribed shares and RCPS-i. 
	The exercise, the group previously said, is aimed at reducing its borrowings to strengthen its balance sheet, and in turn enable it to bid and undertake higher value projects globally. 
	It is an important part of the group’s recapitalisation exercise to pare down its huge borrowings of RM14 billion, of which RM4.59 billion are borrowings from Malayan Banking Bhd, Maybank IB’s parent. 
	Apart from the rights issue, the group also let go of a 50% stake in its exploration and production unit Sapura Upstream Sdn Bhd by forming a joint venture with Austrian integrated oil and gas group OMV Aktiengesellschaft (OMV) to raise cash proceeds of up to US$975 million. 
	In yesterday’s statement, Sapura Energy said proceeds from both the rights issue and the partnership with OMV will be used to repay the group’s borrowings and boost working capital. 
	On completion of both exercises, its gearing ratio is expected to drop from 1.74 times to 0.62 time. 
	“The stronger balance sheet will provide greater financial flexibility for the group to deliver its growth plans. Sapura Energy’s growth strategy continues to see fruition in the increasing number of contract wins. 
	“The successful rights issue comes amidst the group’s contract wins to-date in financial year ending Jan 31, 2019 (FY19) of RM9.3 billion for its engineering and construction and drilling businesses. The group’s growing order book now stands at RM19.3 billion,” it added. 
	Its rights shares with warrants and the RCPS-i will be listed and quoted on the main market of Bursa Malaysia on Jan 29."

	In a statement, the group said the proposal was passed with 99.98% of the votes in favour at the extraordinary general meeting. 
		  
		According to the statement, the group will receive total cash proceeds of RM7.6bil immediately from the rights issue and strategic partnership with OMV. 
		The cash proceeds will go towards repaying the group's borrowings and its gearing ratio is expected to drop from 1.74x to 0.62x, while a portion of the proceeds will fund working capital requirements. 
		""This, together with the savings in finance charges, is expected to positively contribute towards the Group’s future earnings,"" it said.

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Sat, 23 Feb 2019, 12:26 PM ",Sapura expects more jobs on top of US$14.3b already in prospects,,"
	Sapura Energy Bhd is seeing more jobs in the horizon in addition to the US$14.3 billion already in prospects this year despite a sharp decline in oil price to below US$60 a barrel. 
	The integrated oil and gas services company, which has presence in over 20 countries, believes the current oil price level will not put a brake on contract flows in the years to come. 
	Sapura Energy president and group chief executive officer Tan Sri Shahril Shamsuddin said oil majors as well as independents and national oil companies were expected to continue with their exploration and production (E&P) activities to maintain production at current levels. 
	“At this current price level, it is enough (for E&P players) to make projects viable and earn margins. The current oil price is not really a concern for us. We are comfortable with the current level,” Shahril said after the company’s extraordinary general meeting here. 
	“(For oil and gas service contracts), hopefully we will win more next year. Yes, there will be more jobs next year by the oil majors, independents and national oil companies,” he added. 
	Other than providing oil and gas services to national oil companies or oil majors, Sapura Energy is also involved in E&P activities. 
	For its oil and gas services segment, it has tendered for US$14.3 billion worth of jobs this year. 
	The firm will find out if it wins any of them in the next six to 12 months. 
	As of today, the firm had secured US$8.8 billion worth of work, which will keep its earnings sustained for the next three years. 
	Oil price, which is now trading at US$60 a barrel, has been affected by the trade war between the two largest economies, United States and China. 
	However, oil majors were reportedly still spending albeit with capital discipline as they saw growth in certain regions such as Africa, Asia and Latin America. 
	Meanwhile, Shahril said the under-subscription of its rights issue exercise was due to unfavourable investors' sentiment. 
	""I think the sentiments during the rights issue was a bit muddled because there were so many conflicts. There was conflict between US and China and globally on trade that caused a lot of foreign investors to be a bit shy and local investors too. 
	""Institutions held back because they were uncertain of the industry's recovery. Unless you are in the business, you cannot see the pick-up in activity in the sector,"" he said. 
	However, Shahril said the emergence of Permodalan Nasional Bhd as its largest shareholder was a testament to the firm's growth potential. 
	Meanwhile, Sapura Energy shareholders have given the nod for the group's joint venture with OMV Aktiengesellschaft. 
	OMV is buying a 50 per cent stake in Sapura Upstream Sdn Bhd for total proceeds of US$975 million (RM4 billion)."

	Oil and gas (O&G) services provider Sapura Energy Bhd bagged home the Asia Pacific Company of the Year Award under Energy Services, Offshore and Marine category at the Asia Pacific Energy Award Dinner held here by Energy Council, Wednesday. 
	Sapura Energy “toppled” Houston-headquartered Schlumberger and Singapore-based Sembcorp Marine which were the other two contenders for the award. 
	“It is a very big honor for us as a Malaysian company that have been recognised as a company in Asia Pacific,” its group president and chief executive officer Tan Sri Shahril Shamsuddin told Bernama after accepting the Award last night. 
	The Award Dinner was held at Raffles City Convention Center. 
	Shahril attributed the award to the efforts of Sapura Energy’s 13,000 employees over the past many years. 
	“I would like to thank my employees who have stuck with us, weather the storm for the past four to five years and make us come out on top. With humility and pride I received this prize for them.” 
	Shahril also highly acknowledged the support from Sapura Energy’s customers namely Petronas, Shell and Exxon in Malaysia. 
	“They have been great customers for the past years that allow us to get the discipline to become a global company,” said Shahril. 
	As a fully-fledged upstream player, Sapura Energy’s spectrum of capabilities cover the exploration, development, production, rejuvenation, as well as decommissioning and abandonment stages of the value chain. 
	With a highly skilled and technically capable multinational workforce, strategic world-class assets, and strong project management capabilities, the group today has a global presence in over 20 countries. 
	The Energy Council’s Awards which represent a global benchmark of excellence for those working in the oil and gas industry was held in conjunction with the 2019 Asia Pacific Energy Assembly. 
	The Council Awards honour and recognise those in the industry who have been at the heart of the region’s related activity in the last 12 months. 
	Over 50 judges took part over the course of several weeks to whittle down the publicly decided long-list of nominees to determine the rightful winner for each award which was based on a stringent criteria. 
	For energy services, offshore and marine category won by Sapura Energy, overall leadership as an industry benchmark of excellence, was one of the criteria outlined by the Council. 
	Other criteria includes financial performance against peer group (share price, debt levels); operational performance of asset portfolio; recent market transactions and deals; recent operational successes; and strength of industry partnerships. 
	A company’s strength of market reputation, corporate governance, investor relations and public relations were also the criteria drawn by the Council. 
	The Energy Council is the leading member’s platform for deal-initiation and global connectivity in renewables, as well as oil and natural gas sectors.

	Malaysia-based oil and gas (O&G) services provider Sapura Energy Bhd is Austria-listed industrial company, OMV Aktiengesellschaft’s partner of choice. 
	OMV is a relatively new player in the Asia Pacific region. 
	“We were screening companies and assets in the region and Sapura top-ranked. We want to grow our business with Sapura,” the company’s deputy chief executive officer Johann Pleininger told Bernama here recently. 
	He was recalling the selection of Sapura Energy as the company’s new partner in the region, and which eventually saw the setting up of SapuraOMV Upstream Sdn Bhd in November last year, to focus on the Asia Pacific and Mexico. 
	He was met on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Energy Award Dinner held here by the Energy Council, which saw OMV and Sapura claiming “The Asia Pacific Company of the Year of Upstream” and “The Asia Pacific Company of the Year of Energy Services, Offshore and Marine”, awards respectively. 
	According to Pleininger, Sapura Energy group’s production is expected to double or triple over the next five years through the strategic partnership. 
	“Sapura is right now producing about 10,000 barrels per day. We want to achieve 30,000 by the end of 2020 and around 60,000 to 70,000 in 2023,” he said. 
	Pleininger, who is also on OMV’s Executive Board, Upstream, described the partnership with Sapura Energy as a good idea. 
	He expressed OMV’s full commitment to Malaysia and the Asia Pacific region by looking at opportunities to increase business substantially. 
	“It (Sapura Energy) is a long-term partner,” he stressed. 
	Although OMV has been described as the “new kid on the block” in the region, it is currently the biggest oil and gas company in New Zealand. 
	It has also proven its capability by undertaking drastic cost-cutting measures over the last two or three years that saw its production cost fall from US$16.6 per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) to below US$7. 
	“I think we are reaching the level we want to be now,” said Pleininger. 
	Commenting on the ability to run at a low cost to produce energy, Sapura Energy’s president and group chief executive officer, Tan Sri Shahril Shamsuddin, said: “It is an industry-wide effort to be agile, adept and to evolve from a very difficult time from four years ago, to a much better position (now).” 
	He said the industry’s ability to achieve a lower cost base through more effective execution was testimony “on how we work together to achieve this goal.” 
	Asked about the outlook of the O&G industry this year, Shahril sees things improving as stability comes in, with lots of activities and many good things happening. 
	As for Sapura Energy’s recent successful exercise to raise some RM4 billion via a rights issue, he said the company was now in a very good position to take advantage of the increased activities in the O&G industry. 
	Upon completion of the rights issue and joint venture with OMV, Sapura Energy’s gearing ratio will be reduced from 1.74 times to 0.62 times, which Shahril described as a good level for the amount of activities the company has. 
	On Sapura Energy winning the Asia Pacific Company of the Year of Upstream award, he paid tribute to Petronas, as the latter’s vendor development programme had enabled the company to build competencies to be a global player. 
	From a diving contractor to a fully-fledged upstream player, Sapura Energy now has a multinational workforce of about 9,000 and spectrum of capabilities covering engineering, construction and drilling (services segment), as well as exploration and production in more than 20 countries. 
	The services segment order book has grown to RM19.3 billion to date, the highest in the last two years, after having secured multiple contracts across the globe, including in Malaysia, Australia, India, Mexico, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia."

	Malaysia-based oil and gas (O&G) services provider Sapura Energy Bhd is Austria-listed industrial company, OMV Aktiengesellschaft’s partner of choice. 
	OMV is a relatively new player in the Asia Pacific region. 
	“We were screening companies and assets in the region and Sapura top-ranked. We want to grow our business with Sapura,” the company’s deputy chief executive officer Johann Pleininger told Bernama here recently. 
	He was recalling the selection of Sapura Energy as the company’s new partner in the region, and which eventually saw the setting up of SapuraOMV Upstream Sdn Bhd in November last year, to focus on the Asia Pacific and Mexico. 
	He was met on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Energy Award Dinner held here by the Energy Council, which saw OMV and Sapura claiming “The Asia Pacific Company of the Year of Upstream” and “The Asia Pacific Company of the Year of Energy Services, Offshore and Marine”, awards respectively. 
	According to Pleininger, Sapura Energy group’s production is expected to double or triple over the next five years through the strategic partnership. 
	“Sapura is right now producing about 10,000 barrels per day. We want to achieve 30,000 by the end of 2020 and around 60,000 to 70,000 in 2023,” he said. 
	Pleininger, who is also on OMV’s Executive Board, Upstream, described the partnership with Sapura Energy as a good idea. 
	He expressed OMV’s full commitment to Malaysia and the Asia Pacific region by looking at opportunities to increase business substantially. 
	“It (Sapura Energy) is a long-term partner,” he stressed. 
	Although OMV has been described as the “new kid on the block” in the region, it is currently the biggest oil and gas company in New Zealand. 
	It has also proven its capability by undertaking drastic cost-cutting measures over the last two or three years that saw its production cost fall from US$16.6 per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) to below US$7. 
	“I think we are reaching the level we want to be now,” said Pleininger. 
	Commenting on the ability to run at a low cost to produce energy, Sapura Energy’s president and group chief executive officer, Tan Sri Shahril Shamsuddin, said: “It is an industry-wide effort to be agile, adept and to evolve from a very difficult time from four years ago, to a much better position (now).” 
	He said the industry’s ability to achieve a lower cost base through more effective execution was testimony “on how we work together to achieve this goal.” 
	Asked about the outlook of the O&G industry this year, Shahril sees things improving as stability comes in, with lots of activities and many good things happening. 
	As for Sapura Energy’s recent successful exercise to raise some RM4 billion via a rights issue, he said the company was now in a very good position to take advantage of the increased activities in the O&G industry. 
	Upon completion of the rights issue and joint venture with OMV, Sapura Energy’s gearing ratio will be reduced from 1.74 times to 0.62 times, which Shahril described as a good level for the amount of activities the company has. 
	On Sapura Energy winning the Asia Pacific Company of the Year of Upstream award, he paid tribute to Petronas, as the latter’s vendor development programme had enabled the company to build competencies to be a global player. 
	From a diving contractor to a fully-fledged upstream player, Sapura Energy now has a multinational workforce of about 9,000 and spectrum of capabilities covering engineering, construction and drilling (services segment), as well as exploration and production in more than 20 countries. 
	The services segment order book has grown to RM19.3 billion to date, the highest in the last two years, after having secured multiple contracts across the globe, including in Malaysia, Australia, India, Mexico, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia."

		沙里尔表示，过去一年，沙布拉能源总共攫取总值约90亿令吉的新合约，突破市场预期，相信该公司并不是唯一取得更多油气合约的油气公司，在在显示全球油气生产商已投入更多资本开销增产应付市场需求。 
		 
		沙里尔表示，公司攫获90亿的新工程之后，放眼2019年将新合约总值进一步增加至150亿令吉。根据资料显示，目前该公司已手握近200亿令吉的工程合约。 
		其实，国际油气业于2014年开始爆发油价大跌危机，整体行业在2016及2017年最严峻，2018年已经好转，不过以往原油价格每桶超过100美元的风光，短期内难以重演，而未来数年前景仍然可期。 
		沙里尔日前与报界午餐交流时作上述谈话。 
		他举例，沙布拉能源为应付难关，已采取多项措施，其中最关键是成功大幅度减债，以更轻盈脚步再次向前迈进。该公司决心减债所发出的承诺已经落实，特别是发行附加股及沽售旗下的上游业务的50%股权筹资，从而显者改善公司的基本面再向前出发。 
		 
		该公司去年在主要减债行动中，发行附加股及脱售上游业务的50%股权筹资，所得资金主要供减少负债，使公司负债率，已从较早时的1.67倍，大幅度减少至0.67倍。 
		他认为，虽然基本面已显著改善，不过，由于市场对油气股的交投情绪欠佳，或是大市一致认为全球油气业前景波动不靖，对公司前景仍质疑。他也感到无奈，因为一家公司是难以应对整体大市情绪的冲击。 
		他看好全球油气业前景，因为过去数年全球油气生产商都减少资本开销及产油活动，预料未来数年的石油产量将减少，所以全球石油生产商料会增加资本开销及投产活动。 
		谈到市场对美国与中国之间的贸易战料打击全球贸易与经济，从而影响油气市场的需求，沙里尔表示，中美贸易战确实是全球市场的隐忧，惟他有信心美中贸易谈判未来数月会有正面发展。他认为，美中纠纷不太可能持久，毕竟对谁都没有好处，特别是最终也将会伤害到美国及中国的利益。 
		 
		市场甚至担心中美经济将崩跌，惟他对中国有信心，不认为经济将会崩坏，特别是他看到中国在过去20年的经济发展与成长，已具备坚实的能力，没那么容易崩坏。 
		随着该公司获得沙地阿美更多工程合约与更密切的合作，公司计划在今年加强沙地阿拉伯业务，将派遣80名工程师到沙地阿拉伯接触客户及发展当地业务。同时也将进一步加强公司管理层，应付未来挑战。"
5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Fri, 8 Feb 2019, 5:32 PM ",[转贴] 【反向+反转】- 浅谈SAPNRG - Harry,,"
		【反向+反转】- 浅谈SAPNRG 
		SAPNRG的股价在2014年随着油价盘盘而下跌，从此步上了一路向【南】之路。股价从2013年巅峰的RM4.96一度下跌到1月31日的25.5分历史新低，过去3天都闭市在26.5分。 
		2018年，笔者至少做了3次关于SAPNRG的FB LIVE。主要是看到VELESTO (前身UMWOG)已经做了Right Issue，SAPNRG也会很大机会做Right Issue以解决债务的问题。8月尾SAPNRG公布Right Issue的计划之后，股价就再度狂跌，过去5年的跌幅接近95%。 
			来到2019年，笔者反而对这家油气公司有了兴趣。主要是因为Brent Oil的价格在2016年进入底部，2017 - 2018年开始复苏。除了来自上游业的大红花【花开富贵】，其余的油气股由于债务缠身以及各种Impairment导致亏损连连。 
			最近比较火热的就有CARIMIN以及DAYANG等，公司过去1 - 2个季度已经看到盈利，因此不少投资者已经进场。以反向思维来看待的话，油气股的下跌空间已经非常有限。而且未来1 - 2年很可能会出现反转的机会，反转成功之后不久变成了趋势吗？ 
			但是在了解/投资油气股之前，必须了解油气领域的风险！ 
			【油气领域的风险是什么？】 
			1. 大部分油气股债台高筑，赚的钱不够还利息以及借贷 
			2. 油价波动非常大，之前Brent Oil就从USD86.74跌倒USD49.93，过后反弹到现在的USD61 ++。 
			3. 除了上游业（本身有油田产油）的公司，中下游是非常依靠合约的。 
			4. 时间成本，可能要等1 - 2年才会看到盈利。虽然国际油价已经从底部复苏2年，但是很多中下游是在过去1年才开始获得合约，因此可能需要几个季度后才会开始贡献盈利。 
			*不过最近国家石油Petronas有提高动力的迹象，国油最新的报告显示，本地油气领域整个价值链中活动都将呈扬势。 
			SAPNRG现在最大的问题在哪里？？ 
			大部分的投资者都会说债务过高，这点笔者是非常赞同的。不过经过Right Issue以及卖掉50%E&P上游业务给Austria的OMV之后，Gearing Ratio预计会从1.74降低到0.62，预计每年可以剩下RM314 mil的Finance Cost。 
			不过公司的计算是用FY18Q4的数据，因此笔者用最新FY19Q3的Borrowing = RM172.206亿做计算，预计最新的Gearing ratio是0.63 - 0.64之间，预计会还掉RM66亿的债务（会因为汇率的变动有所改变）。 
			因此债务的问题暂时是获得舒缓，不过Right Issue导致股票数量暴增了168%，增加到15,979 mil股。而且等到7年后免费凭单SAPNRG-WA以及RCPS-i到期的话，股票总数会暴增到19,370 mil。 
			以上就是市场最担心的问题，因为票数增加导致盈利被Diluted，卖压在1月28日的特别股东大会激增，很多人推测是3家Underwriter Bank卖掉他们手上认购附加股的票。 
			SAPNRG的附加股有18.5%没有人要认购，因此Underwriter Bank 必须吸纳18.5% x 9,986 mil附加股，这3家银行被【逼】吞掉接近18.47亿股。不过这3家公司认购也会获得1.847亿股的免费凭单，可以抵消一部分股价下跌的亏损。 
			以现在SAPNRG-WA = 9.5分的价格计算，这些WA大约值RM17.55 mil。 
			因此预计这几家银行暂时Paper Losses是RM28 - 30 mil之间。不过假设股价可以起回30分，他们手上的免费凭单是多赚的。 
			****以上纯属推测计算，准确数据只要Bank自己知道。 
			很多人认为管理层很有问题，怎么办？？ 
			现在PNB持有SAPNRG高达40%的股权，管理层已经不是最大的股东。因此PNB必定会非常谨慎监管管理层的资金运用，避免不当的开销以及舞弊的存在。而且所获得的资金里85％以上会用来还债，剩下的10亿左右当作营运资本。以正常的思维来看，相信有点远见以及志气的管理层不会做傻事。 
			回归基本面，SAPNRG在过去12个月获得了RM93亿的合约，手握的合约总共是RM193亿，足够公司忙碌3 - 4年。而且公司现在也竞标着大笔的合约，在公司的财务状况有所改善之后，公司获得更多合约的机率也随之增加。而且他们的策略伙伴OMW也可以在未来介绍更多的跨国油气公司给SAPNRG，间接也增加SAPNRG的瀑光率以及潜在客户。 
			Austria的State Government持有31.5%的OMV，而PNB持有40%的SAPNRG。间接可以说是两个国家之间的合作，而且OMV的市值大约是RM650亿++，规模也比SAPNRG大得多。管理层在特别股东大会说到，希望透过OMV的经验以及技术优化SAPNRG的成本，为公司创造更多的价值。 
			公司在FY2015 - 18已经做了RM4,470.6亿的Provision for Impairment on property, plant and equipment oil and gas properties，笔者也在特别股东大会询问，未来还会做Impairment吗？ 
			**管理层回答没有“突发情况”的话，理论上是不会做impairment的。** 
			这家公司有很多人不看好，但是也是有人看好。就让时间去证明吧，这家公司至少需要1 - 2年的时间才能看到成绩。冷眼前辈的分享里也曾经说到，有意买进的话用10%的资金，毕竟这是险中求富贵。 
			笔者本身持有SAPNRG这家油气公司，以上的优势，缺点以及风险都分享给大家做参考。共勉之。 
			****记得，买卖任何股票之前都要勤劳做功课，任何买卖上的亏损，恕本页面不负责。

	Figure 1: Quarter Revenue of SAPNRG 
	 
	Figure 2: Quarter profit of SAPNRG 
	Figure 1 and Figure 2 shows that SAPNRG fails to convert sales to profit, as losses have been created continuously since 4Q17. 
	 
	Figure 3: Quarter PE ratio of SAPNRG 
	 
	Figure 4: Quarter ROE of SAPNRG 
	SAPNRG’s quarter profits and PE ratio exhibit the similar trend showing that the share price of SAPNRG is at its fair value. As a result of the losses created since 4Q17, SAPNRG’s PE ratio and ROE indicate negative values. 
	 
	Based on the analysis above, it is a fundamentally poor stock, as it fails most of the fundamental tests. Normally, we will not pick stocks with fundamental rating which is less than 2.5 for long term investment. 
	  
	 
	Sapura Energy has faced long term down-trend since 2016 - challenges remain strong for oil & gas sector as the brent crude oil price remain volatile.   
	 
	 
	 
	 
	SAPNRG has been experiencing a long-term bearish trend for a year and it is still undergoing down-trending price movement, as MQ technical rating is indicating 2.2/5.0 at the moment. Based on MQ Trader criteria, a stock with bullish trend should achieve MQ technical rating that is higher than 3.0/5.0. 
	Sell signals are detected by most of the MQ Trader trading strategies confirming the selling momentum on SAPNRG’s shares as shown in EMA 5 Crossover charts above.  Furthermore, technical indicators such as ADX and OBV are showing negative results due to greater selling pressure over buying pressure. 
	One of the main reason that causes SAPNRG’s recent down-trending share price movement is the under-subscription of its right shares. The under-subscription rate of 18.5% results in the 1.8bil ordinary shares to be held by the underwriters Maybank Investment Bank, CIMB Investment Bank and RHB Investment Bank. Provided Sapura’s average daily trading volume is 116mil over the past 1 year, the underwriters will require a few months to dispose these shares. Thus, it is expected that the selling pressure will be greater than buying pressure during this period. 
	According to the analysis above, we will save our capital for better opportunities instead of holding or buying the share that are in downtrend, especially for those without good fundamentals. At the meantime, we will monitor the momentum of fundamentally strong counters (Fundamental rating > 2.5) with mid-term bullish up-trending chart patterns.

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Tue, 29 Jan 2019, 8:45 AM ",PublicInvest Research Headlines - 29 Jan 2019,Economy Markets Market Update," The US Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis said it was delaying the release of advance 4Q GDP data scheduled for Wednesday because of the just-ended five-week partial government shutdown. The record-long shutdown prevented the collection of reports ranging from retail sales to construction spending, which go into the calculation of the GDP report. Economists, investors and businesses count on data from the Commerce Department agencies, including the Census Bureau, which were shuttered during the 35-day partial closure of the government. The government shutdown, which ended on Friday, has also delayed the release of Dec personal income report and trade data. (Reuters)  Tariffs imposed by the Trump administration will limit growth of US real GDP by an average of 0.1% each year for the next 10 years if they remain in place at current levels, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) said. The growth of GDP would be curbed by a drop in consumer spending power and a fall in US exports. Those declines would be only partly offset by an expected increase in output as domestic goods replace imports. President Donald Trump’s administration last year slapped tariffs on goods from China and other countries, as Trump sought better trade terms. The outlook for the impact of these tariffs, and retaliation from trading partners, was part of the CBO’s updated budget forecasts. (Reuters)  While the federal government has finally reopened, a report from the Congressional Budget Office estimates the record-setting shutdown will still have a permanent, negative effect on the economy. The CBO estimated that reduced economic activity as a result of the shutdown lowered GDP by USD3bn in the 4Q of 2018 and by USD8bn in the 1Q of 2019. As a percentage, the level of real GDP was reduced by 0.1% in the 4Q and is expected to be reduced by 0.2% in the 1Q. Most of the real GDP lost during the shutdown will eventually be recovered in subsequent quarters, although the CBO estimates that about USD3bn will not be. (RTT)  A no deal Brexit could create yet another headache for the European Union as it prepares to hand dozens of UK based companies a tax bill that is expected to top USD1.5bn. With just over two months until Britain’s scheduled departure date of March 29, time is running out for the European Commission to order the UK to recoup money from companies granted illegal tax breaks. A decision is likely just before Brexit, people familiar with the case have said. But how the EU could ensure UK compliance with any order isn’t clear. A no-deal Brexit would mean the withdrawal agreement and transition period negotiated for months toward an orderly EU exit, wouldn’t apply. (Bloomberg)  Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras announced on Monday plans to increase the standard minimum monthly wage by about 11%, the first such wage hike in the country in almost a decade. “I’m calling on you, after a decade of wage cuts, to make another historic step,” Tsipras said, calling on his cabinet to approve the labour ministry’s proposal for an increase to EU650 from EU586 currently. Tsipras also proposed that a youth minimum wage - for those below 25 - is abolished. (Reuters)  Earnings at China’s industrial firms shrank for a second straight month in Dec, putting pressure on policymakers to support industries hurt by slowing prices and weak factory activity amid a protracted US-Sino trade war. The downbeat data points to more troubles ahead for the country’s vast manufacturing sector already struggling with a decline in orders, job layoffs and factory closures as China’s economic growth slows to its weakest in nearly three decades. China’s economy expanded 6.6% in 2018 and growth is set to slow further this year as Beijing’s efforts to reduce debt risks depress the property market and curb credit flows to the private sector, while a crackdown on pollution dents industrial activity. (Reuters)  It has completed the issuance of RM358.1m worth of Islamic medium-term notes to part finance the purchase of a project land in Semenyih, Selangor. The property developer said that the notes were issued under an unrated sukuk programme by its wholly-owned subsidiary KL East SB. The sukuk programme will have a tenure of up to 10 years from the date of the first issue. (The Edge)  Sapura Energy has received shareholders approval for the 50:50 strategic partnership with Austria’s OMV Aktiengesellschaft. The group said the proposal was passed with 99.98% of the votes in favour at the EGM. Under the partnership, OMW will acquire a 50% stake in Sapura Energy's wholly owned subsidiary Sapura Upstream SB, based on an enterprise value of up to RM6.6bn. The group will receive up to RM4bn in cash and recognise a net gain of RM2.7bn for the 50% stake sale. The group will receive total cash proceeds of RM7.6bn immediately from the rights issue and strategic partnership with OMV. (StarBiz)  Malaysian Resources Corp (MRCB) said it has received a letter of acceptance from Turnpike Synergy SB, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Projek Lintasan Kota Holdings SB, to accept MRCB's offer to undertake Package CA2 of the Sungai Besi-Ulu Kelang Elevated Expressway (SUKE) project at RM323m. The completion date of the project is April 3, 2020, 14 months from the date of site possession on Feb 4. (The Edge)  Scomi Energy Services said its unit, Scomi Sosma SB, is divesting all interests held in Scomi Anticor SAS to a German procurement firm for USD3.7m (RM15.21m). The acquisition of the interests in Scomi Anticor was undertaken in Aug 2006 for RM4.9m, and the sale is expected to result in a gain of USD2.3m (RM9.45m) to the group, it said. (The Edge)  FGV Holdings has entered a MoU with South Korea's Samyang Foods Co Ltd to establish a halal ramen manufacturing facility in Malaysia. FGV Group CEO Datuk Haris Fadzilah Hassan said the collaboration is part of the FGV's strategic direction to expand its downstream business by diversifying its product offerings and penetrating new markets. (StarBiz)  Tex Cycle said the commencement of feed-in-tariff for its renewable electrical energy power plant in Selangor has been delayed once again. This is because the group is still waiting for the initial operation date (IOD) from the relevant authorities. It had received the greenlight from the Sustainable Energy Development Authority Malaysia (SEDA) to build and operate the power plant, which will have a capacity to supply two megawatt per hour of electricity to TNB.  Hume Industries’ net loss for the 2QFY19 widened to RM27.1m compared with a net loss of RM4.4m chalked up in the same period last year. However, revenue came in slightly higher at RM163m versus RM162.9m previously. It said although the full commissioning and increase in reliability of its second production line of the cement business had resulted in higher sales volume, losses before tax increased mainly due to the lower selling price of cement. (Bernama) The FBM KLCI might open lower today after global stocks started the week on a nervous note as unsettling trading updates from Caterpillar and Nvidia added weight to recent concerns about the outlook for the Chinese economy. China concerns also weighed on oil prices, with Brent dipping below the $60 a barrel mark, and there was also an element of caution in the markets ahead of this week’s Federal Reserve meeting. Participants will be keen to see if the central bank maintains its “patient” stance on interest rates, and will be watching for any updates regarding its balance sheet unwind. But it was the warnings from Caterpillar and semiconductor group Nvidia that dominated the market mood. The former said it expected no sales growth in China this year, and only a “modest” increase worldwide. Nvidia, meanwhile, cut its fourth-quarter revenue guidance, citing weak demand in China for its gaming chips. Furthermore, Apple supplier Japan Display said it expected a “harsh” impact on earnings from the US-China trade war. Trade talks between the two countries are scheduled to take place this week. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 fell 0.8% to 2,643, off the day’s low of 2,624. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also fell 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite ended 1.1% lower. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 index ended 1% lower as the Xetra Dax in Frankfurt fell 0.6% and London’s FTSE 100 shed 0.9%. Back home, the FBM KLCI index lost 3.53 points or 0.21% to 1,697.5 points on Monday. Trading volume decreased to 2.25bn worth RM1.95bn.

	沙布拉能源（SAPNRG）的附加股得到大部分认购（81.49%），剩余的由三家投资银行包销，而优先股更是全数认购，公司成功募集了40亿令吉，踏出了成功的第一步。 
	这次的附加股得以成功进行，国民投资公司（PNB）功不可没。 
	事实上，许多小股东因为母股市价还低于认购价30仙，不想无需劳师动众的去认购附加股而选择放弃权益，因为直接买入母股来得更便宜。 
	人弃我取，这也让国民投资公司得其所哉，顺利增持公司股权至40%。 
	须知道，如果国民投资公司要在公开市场从12.15%增持到40%（几十亿股额），且维持同一个30仙的买价，是不大可能的事。 
		沙布拉能源积极开源节流。 
	 
	公司的下一步将是在1月28日召开的股东特大。这会议寻求股东批准公司和澳洲OMV集团设立一家50:50的策略联盟公司，共同投资于沙布拉探勘油气（简称沙布拉上游，SEB UPSTREAM S/B）。 
	如果成功获得股东放行，公司将套现一笔9.75亿美元的现金，用以还债及其他营运资金。 
	在双管齐下，总共筹得80亿令吉并还债之后，沙布拉能源的负债比将从1.74倍降低至0.62倍，公司因此每年得以节省利息高达3.14亿令吉，以公司160亿股额来计算，这可是省了每股2仙。 
	 
	也就是说，当重组完毕，公司比之前少花了2仙于利息，这个节省下来的利息，反过来说就是赚了2仙。 
	所谓开源节流，除了节流以外，公司也积极开源，去年成功赢取90亿令吉以上的合约，至今订单增加至193亿令吉。预料公司在债务减轻之下，将有能力竞标更多工程。 
	 
	另外，由于沙布拉能源的特大在1月28日召开，一旦议案通过，根据通告中披露，交易将在1月31日完成（即公司2019年第4季）。 
	脱售沙布拉上游50%将让公司获得一笔不小的盈利（大约是30亿令吉），以此计算，公司将在本财政年（2019年）转亏为盈。 
	该公司着急部署2019财政年取得盈利（全年大约是每股15仙），目的不外是打铁趁热，欲漂亮启动公司未来几年成长和盈利的列车。 
	眼看一切利好已经在位，重振沙布拉能源声威近在眉睫，难怪冷眼前辈一而再，再而三的暗示我们火中取栗要靠拼“油气”。 
	 
	写到这里，发现冷眼前辈提到的另一只油气股布米阿玛达（ARMADA）已经大起，致使之前在16仙没有买进的投资者踌躇不前。 
	不过，我们不晓得它会否效仿沙布拉能源也来个附加股建议呢？ 
	 
	1月28日是沙布拉能源（SAPNRG）的股东特大。 
	30日则是国云集团（PLB）的股东大会。

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Wed, 23 Jan 2019, 9:24 AM ",PublicInvest Research Headlines - 23 Jan 2019,Economy Markets Market Update," US home sales tumbled to their lowest level in three years in Dec and house price increases slowed sharply, suggesting a further loss of momentum in the housing market. The weak report from the National Association of Realtors (NAR) on Tuesday was the latest indication of slowing economic growth. A survey last Friday showed consumer sentiment dropped in Jan to its lowest level since President Donald Trump was elected more than two years ago. Existing home sales were now the weakest since Trump was elected, said MUFG Chief Economist Chris Rupkey, “signaling the initial confidence boost from the new ideas and new legislation is falling flat.” The NAR said existing home sales declined 6.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.99m units last month. That was the lowest level since Nov 2015. (Reuters)  UK budget deficit for Dec exceeded economists' expectations and was the second lowest figure for the month in 18 years, figures from the Office for National Statistics showed Tuesday. The public sector net borrowing, or PSNB, was GBP3bn in Dec, which was GBP0.3bn more than a year ago. Economists had forecast borrowing of GBP1.9bn. That was the lowest Dec borrowing for 18 years, save for a GBP2.7bn borrowing in Dec 2017. The PSNB was GBP35.9bn in the YTD period, which was GBP13.1bn less than the same period in 2017. That was also the lowest YTD figure for 16 years. (RTT)  The UK employment hit a record high in Dec and the workers' pay grew at the fastest pace in a decade amid steady unemployment, despite the Brexit chaos. The employment level grew by 141,000 sequentially to a record high 32.54m in the three months to Nov, figures from the Office for National Statistics showed on Tuesday. Economists were looking for an increase of 87,000. The rate of employment rose to 75.8%, which was the highest since comparable records began in 1971. The number of unemployed was 1.37m in the three months to Nov, broadly unchanged from the previous three months ended Aug. The figure dropped by 68,000 from a year earlier. The ILO jobless rate was 4% in the three months to Nov, which was the lowest since Dec 1974 to Feb 1975 period, and unchanged from the three months ended Aug. (RTT)  The UK Parliament is edging closer to a plan to delay Brexit in order to stop the country dropping out of the European Union with no deal. The main opposition Labour Party is now increasingly likely to support a move to extend the March 29 exit day deadline, if Prime Minister Theresa May fails to negotiate a divorce agreement, said John McDonnell, the party’s chief finance spokesman. McDonnell described the proposal as a “sensible” way to avoid an economically disastrous no-deal Brexit. If Labour does support the proposal, put forward by lawmakers including Yvette Cooper, a former minister, it is far more likely to win enough backing to be passed. That would force May’s hand and ensure she cannot take Britain out of the EU without a deal in nine weeks’ time. (Bloomberg)  Weakness in the service and farm sectors slowed China’s economic growth in the fourth quarter, despite a strong pickup in construction activity, official data showed on Tuesday. Services grew 7.4% from a year earlier, slowing from 7.9% in the 3Q, while growth in agriculture slowed to 3.5% from 3.6%, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said. The services sector accounted for almost half of GDP in the quarter by value as China continued to transition towards a service-oriented economy, while agriculture contributed about 10%, according to Reuters’ calculations based on the latest data. Construction enjoyed a strong recovery thanks to support for infrastructure projects, as the government frontloaded local government bond issuance to support their financing. (Reuters)  Bank Negara Malaysia's international reserves rose by USD300m to USD101.7bn as at Jan 15 from two weeks earlier. The central bank said the reserve position was sufficient to finance 7.3 months of retained imports and was one time the short-term external debt. As at Dec 31, the reserves were at USD101.4bn after taking into account the quarterly adjustment for foreign exchange revaluation changes. The reserves position then was sufficient to finance 7.4 months of retained imports and is 1.0 time the short-term external debt. The ringgit firmed up against the USD to 4.0975 at Jan 15 from 4.1385 on Dec 31. (StarBiz)  Sapura Energy announced that it has successfully raised about RM4bn from its rights issue exercise that closed on Jan 16, though the rights issue of ordinary shares under the exercise was undersubscribed. The rights issue comprises the rights issue of ordinary shares sweetened with free warrants and Islamic redeemable convertible preference shares (RCPS-i). While the first portion that is to raise about RM3bn was under-subscribed, with a subscription rate of 81.5%, the preference shares to raise some RM1bn was over-subscribed by 1.18%. (The Edge)  Destini has bagged a contract from Carigali-PTTEPI Operating Co SB (CPOC) to provide tubular running services for exploration and appraisal and infill drilling campaign for Block B-17 & C-19 and Block B-17-01 located at the lower part of Gulf of Thailand. The value of the contract was not disclosed. Destini said its wholly-owned subsidiary Destini Oil Services SB has on Jan 14 received a letter of award from CPOC the operator of the petroleum blocks for the proposed project. (The Edge)  HeiTech Padu has secured a Ministry of Health (MoH) contract worth RM33.18m. The contract is for the supply, installation and commissioning of the Critical Care Information System (CCIS) in intensive care units of 11 hospitals for a period of three years. The contract, which will commence on Feb 1, 2019, is expected to have positive impacts on its future earnings. The contract will have no material effect to its net asset, dividend policy, share capital and substantial shareholdings for the FYR Dec 31, 2019. (The Edge)  Bina Puri Holdings joint venture (JV) with Tim Sekata SB has bagged a RM251.53m contract to undertake sub contract works for the electrified double track project from Gemas to Johor Baru. The group's unbuilt book order stands at RM1.145bn with the latest award. Bina Puri Builder SB has accepted the letter of award from Syarikat Pembenaan Yeoh Tiong Lay SB on Jan 15, 2019 for the proposed job. (The Edge)  K-One Technology has secured a manufacturing agreement with a new US customer to manufacture dental water flosser that it forecasts will generate sales of about RM10m each year, for the first three years. The deal was secured via its wholly-owned subsidiary K One Resources SB. The customer is part of a US-based multinational. Tooling is expected to commence in the 1Q2019, which will be followed by manufacturing of the products at the end of the subsequent quarter. (The Edge)  Country View net profit surged over five times in 4QFY18 to RM52.03m from RM9.54m in the same quarter last year, mainly due to the completion of disposal of lands in Kedah in the quarter under review. The strong net profit growth, however, was partly offset by higher administrative expenses arising from the allowance on fair value losses on investment properties in 4QFY18 in order to reflect the fair value of the investment properties as at Nov 30, 2018. (The Edge) The FBM KLCI might open lower today after pessimism on the outlook for global growth, along with lingering uncertainty over the prospects for US-China trade talks, helped drag down equities and oil prices while offering support to Treasuries, the yen and gold. The IMF lowered its forecasts for GDP growth this year and next in both advanced and emerging economies, citing risks including trade tensions, Brexit and the budgetary position of Italy. The downgrades came hard on the heels of data showing that China’s economy had expanded in 2018 at the slowest pace for almost three decades. And there was little comfort for growth bulls from data released on Tuesday showing that US existing home sales dropped 6.4 percent last month to the lowest level since November 2015. As US markets reopened after Monday’s holiday, the S&P 500 equity index gave back all of Friday’s advance, while Brent oil retreated after hitting a six-week high above $63 a barrel in the previous session. At the closing bell, the S&P 500 fell 1.4% to 2,633 — following a 1.3% advance on Friday — having been down as much as 2% at one stage. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.2% and the Nasdaq Composite ended 1.9% lower. In Europe, the pan-regional Stoxx 600 index ended 0.4% lower, as London’s FTSE 100 fell 1% and the Xetra Dax in Frankfurt shed 0.4%. Back home, the FBM KLCI index gained 9.90 points or 0.59% to 1,702.12 points on Tuesday. Trading volume increased to 3.32bn worth RM2.12bn. Market breadth was negative with 332 gainers as compared to 556 losers. In the region, the CSI 300 index of mainland China’s stocks fell 1.3%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index finished 0.7% softer.

	你肯定听过“守株待兔”的寓言： 
	一只野兔被野狼追逐，狂奔逃命，竟误撞大树而死，一个笨汉刚好路过此处，拾到这只野兔，欣喜若狂。于是他抛下农事，守在树下，等待另一只野兔出现也撞树而死，他痴痴地等，等……这就是“守株待兔”。 
	作为散户，我们根本“玩”不过股市和油市，无从知道两“节”何时会翻身，就好像笨汉根本无法知道另一只野兔会不会出现，或何时会出现。除了痴痴的等待，别无他法。但是，股市笨汉若能锲而不舍坚守到底，另一只“野兔”必然会出现，而且可能比第一只更大、更肥。 
	要长期持守，则所投资的公司必须没有破产的风险，如果公司破产，投资者的投资将化为乌有，散户的资金都是血汗钱，全军覆没的风险冒不得。故所购买的油气股，必须具备以下全部或部分条件： 
	（１）有关公司最好有财雄势大的财团或机构作后盾，确保必要时有能力出手援救。 
	（２）最好选购大公司的股票，大到不能倒则更佳。这不纯粹是安全问题，而是因为国际油气公司不会将合同颁给小公司，以免受到延误，故大公司在竞标国际合同时占有优势。 
	（３）最好是手头握有数额可观合同的公司，确保三五年内即使标不到工程，或是得标数目低于预期，业务也不会受到影响。 
	（４）尽量选购本身拥有油田，同时也从事油气业支援服务的公司。 
	（５）所选公司最好现金流量属“净流入” 。 
	（６）尽量买在扣除“资产减值”之后，仍有盈利或亏蚀额不大的公司的股票。 
	（７）尽量购置营业量大的公司股票，营业量不大，表示有关公司没有竞标优势，若因竞标激烈而赚率又低，怎料取得可观盈利？ 
	 
	我鼓励股市菜鸟们以油气股为例，学习做功课，最好是将所读过的资料，写在一本笔记簿上，随时温习。我的经验是读10次不如写一次印象更深，如此不断的累积知识，持之以恒，就能达到融会贯通的地步。 
	关于油气股，菜鸟们可以这样做： 
	（１）利用图表，了解有关公司过去5年（10年更佳）的股价波动幅度，从而看出目前的股价是处于高、中、低价的哪个位置。（股票行多数有提供股价图表），处于低价者上升潜能较大。 
	（2）从年报找出过去5年的业绩纪录，预测若油价回升至5年前的水平（油价100美元以上），公司可能赚多少。 
	（3）阅读过去5年的年报、季报和文告（尤其是宣布得标的文告），详读年报中的“管理层讨论与分析，里面有丰富资料，可以增加对公司的了解。此部分是以往（3年前）年报所没有的，是交易所新的规定，非读不可。 
	（4）从年报和季报，找出有关公司的亏蚀中，有多少是因“资产减值”造成的，如果没有“资产减值”，公司赚多少，或是少亏多少。例如沙布拉能源2018年亏蚀25亿令吉，其中21亿令吉是“资产减值”，实际营业亏蚀额没有这么大。（见 第126页“现金流量表”）。 
	布米阿玛达在至2018年9月的第三季亏蚀5亿200万，在扣除了5亿635万令吉的“资产减值”及其他一次过减值项目后，实际上取得7520万令吉的营业净利（ 及传媒文告）。 
	 
	（5）从年报季报和文告，找出手头持有多少合同（工作量），除以每年的营业量，就知道手头的工作可支持多少年，万一来年没有标到新工作，或是所标得的工作量少于预期，公司的操作也不会受影响。例如沙布拉能源在2019年开始，手头持有194亿令吉的合同，以上一个财务年的营业量计算，约可支持3年（见 ）。 
	布米阿玛达在去年9月底时持有210亿令吉的合同，以上一个财务年的24亿营业量计算，约可支持8年，另外该公司持有选择权，可延长103亿令吉的合同，这尚不包括在上述合同之内（见该公司 ）。 
	（6）跟踪油价变动，你可以从互联网找到布兰特原油每天的报价，从而了解油气市场的趋势，例如在写本文时（1月9日），每桶布兰特油价为61美元。 
	你只要 ，就可以找到每天的布兰特油价，长期跟踪就可以洞察油市的走势。 
	以上网址也载有5年的油价图，你能看到过去5年的油价波幅，一目了然。 
	（7）多读股票分析师的分析，比如沙布拉能源于本月7日宣布标得7亿6000万令吉的新工作，各股票行的分析师于8日就发表了分析报告。 
	报告也指出，沙布拉在过去一年所标得的工程量约为93亿令吉。使总工作量达到194亿令吉。这类分析可以帮助你跟踪沙布拉的最新发展，余者类推（见 ）。 
	菜鸟们，如果你们想在股市淘金，除了勤做功课、多思考之外，别无他途。

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Thu, 10 Jan 2019, 9:39 AM ",PublicInvest Research Headlines - 10 Jan 2019,Economy Markets Market Update," Minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's latest meeting confirmed Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's recent remarks suggesting the central bank will take a patient approach to further interest rate increases. The minutes of the FOMC's Dec meeting showed participants saw the appropriate extent and timing of future rate hikes as less clear than earlier. The Fed decided to raise rates by a quarter points at the meeting, but the minutes suggest volatility in financial markets and increased concerns about global economic growth have clouded the outlook for rates. A number of participants noted it was important for the FOMC to assess the impact of increasingly pronounced risks and the effects of past rate hikes before making further changes to the stance of monetary policy. (RTT)  As President Donald Trump jawbones the Federal Reserve, the likelihood that he's going get what he wants this year from the central bank continues to grow. Markets expect the Fed to hold off on rate hikes and are even anticipating the possibility of a cut during the next year or two, playing into the low-rate environment the president has espoused. That in turn would decrease the chances that Trump might try to fire Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, a move universally regarded as difficult to achieve and likely disruptive if not disastrous for the market. That chance may have declined even more in recent days as market conditions improved. (CNBC)  The Trump administration wrapped up the latest round of trade talks in Beijing, noting a commitment by China to buy more US agricultural goods, energy and manufactured items. China and the US concluded three days of talks on Wednesday, with a cautious sense of optimism that the world’s two biggest economies might be able to reach a deal that ends their bruising trade war. In a statement, the office of US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the two sides considered ways to “achieve fairness, reciprocity, and balance in trade relations.” Officials discussed the need for any deal to include “ongoing verification and effective enforcement. The US will decide on the next steps after officials report back to Washington. (Bloomberg)  Chinese and US teams ended trade talks here that lasted longer than expected and officials said details will be released soon, raising hopes an all-out trade war that could badly disrupt the global economy can be avoided. The talks were extended into an unscheduled third day, showing both sides were serious, China’s Foreign Ministry said. Ted McKinney, US undersecretary of agriculture for trade and foreign agricultural affairs, said the US trade delegation would return to the United States after a good few days. Speaking at a daily news briefing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang confirmed both sides had agreed to extend the talks beyond Monday and Tuesday as originally scheduled. (Reuters)  Unemployment in the eurozone unexpectedly fell in Nov to its lowest rate in more than ten years, official estimates released showed. The EU statistics office Eurostat said unemployment in the 19-country currency bloc dropped to 7.9% in Nov, the lowest level since Oct 2008, and below economists’ forecasts of an 8.1% rate. Eurostat also revised down its Oct reading to 8.0% from a previous estimate of 8.1%. The fall was partly caused by a drop of the number of jobless in Italy and Spain which still have the highest unemployment rates in the eurozone after Greece. Unemployment fell to 14.7% in Spain from 14.8% in Oct. It went down to 10.5% in Italy from 10.6%. The latest figures available for Greece show an 18.6% rate in Sept. (Reuters)  Germany's merchandise trade surplus grew in Nov to its biggest level in five months as imports fell unexpectedly, and exports decreased, giving further evidence of a slowdown in the biggest euro area economy. The non-adjusted trade surplus grew to EUR20.5bn from EUR18.9bn in Oct, preliminary data from the Federal Statistical Office showed. Economists had expected a surplus of EUR18.6bn. The latest surplus was the biggest since June, when the figure was EUR22bn. On a seasonally and calendar adjusted basis, the trade surplus increased to EUR19bn from EUR17.9bn in Oct. That was also the biggest since June. In Nov, the decline in imports outstripped the fall in exports. Imports decreased a seasonally adjusted 1.6% from the previous month after a 0.8% increase in Oct. (RTT)  China’s Finance Ministry is set to propose a small increase in the targeted budget deficit for this year as officials seek to balance support for the economy with the need to keep control of debt levels. The ministry agreed the proposed deficit target of 2.8% of GDP at its annual work conference in Dec, two people familiar with the matter said. The figure, which compares with 2018’s target of 2.6%, will be presented for approval at the National People’s Congress, China’s legislature, in March. The final number could still change. While officials have pledged a pro-active fiscal policy this year amid a slowdown in the economy that’s being worsened by the trade war with the US, the proposed deficit expansion is smaller than many economists had forecast. (Bloomberg)  Japan’s labor ministry has issued wage data without meeting sampling standards, officials said, undermining the credibility of a key indicator used to gauge the success of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic policies. In compiling the monthly data, which covers some 33,000 firms nationwide with five or more full-time employees each, the labor ministry is supposed to collect samples from all the firms that employ 500 or more workers. But it turned out that the data sampling failed to cover two thirds of some 1,400 businesses in Tokyo for an unspecified period of time. Domestic media reported the sampling error extends back for 15 years, but officials stopped short of confirming the period, saying that the matter was still under investigation. (Reuters)  AirAsia Group, which is divesting its aircraft leasing business to entities managed by BBAM Ltd Partnership, said plans to lease five of the aircraft to third party airlines with an enterprise value (EV) of USD173.67m have been aborted. It said the leasing of the aircraft will not take place as the agreements have now lapsed. (The Edge)  SEB Upstream SB (SUP), a joint venture between Sapura Energy Bhd and OMV Aktiengesellschaft (OMV AG), plans to obtain financing facilities from local and foreign financial institutions and/or its Austrian partner for between USD350m (RM1.46bn) and USD550m (RM2.29bn) to repay part of its debt and for working capital. It said SUP will use USD350m to partially repay the amount owing by it to Sapura Energy of USD890m (RM3.7bn) and the rest for working capital. (The Edge)  WCT Holdings, which is substantially owned by Tan Sri Desmond Lim of the Pavilion group with a 19.67% stake, and China-based China Communications and Construction Group (CCCG), will jointly develop the first residential project at the Tun Razak Exchange (TRX) here, with an estimated GDV of RM1.1bn. The development is scheduled to be completed around the end of 2022. (The Edge)  ConnectCounty Holdings said its wholly-owned China-based unit Rapid Conn (Shenzhen) Co Ltd (RCC) has divested a 31% stake in its subsidiary, Shenzhen Rapid Power Co Ltd, for a total of CNY2.33m, or approximately RM1.4m. The transfer of shares was done as part of RCC’s equity restructuring of subsidiaries due to changing business circumstances in China, it said.

The dollar hit its lowest level against a basket of currencies for nearly three months as expectations mounted that the Federal Reserve would adopt a more cautious policy stance over the coming year. The minutes of the Fed’s meeting last month showed that recent volatility in financial markets and muted US inflation had encouraged “many participants” to take the view that the central bank could afford to be patient about further rate rises. Earlier in the day, several Fed officials made cautious comments about the path of US monetary policy.

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Tue, 8 Jan 2019, 8:45 AM ",Sapura Energy - Contracts Worth RM760m,,"Yesterday, SAPNRG announced that it has secured new contracts/extensions, which included (i) drilling – one new contract from Chevron Corporation in Angola, and two contract extensions in Malaysia from Sarawak Shell Berhad / Sabah Shell Petroleum and Petronas Carigali, and (ii) engineering & construction (E&C) – two new contracts from Petronas and Hess Exploration and Production Malaysia (refer table below for the detailed breakdown of all contracts / extensions awarded). Combined, these contracts are valued at approximately RM760m. Overall, we are positive on the contract wins and extensions as it not only highlights the company’s competitiveness and job winning abilities, but also signifies its jobs execution quality to warrant the contract extensions. In fact, Angola (Africa) represents an entirely new market for its drilling segment, with all of its rigs currently operating in Southeast Asia. Meanwhile, these contracts have brought YTD wins to roughly c.RM9b (in line with our order-book replenishment assumption of RM9b), and lifted order-book to an estimated RM19b – its highest in over two years. We expect EBIT margins for the E&C contracts to be within 10-20%, but still its drilling segment is seen to continue making losses. The new contract is also expected to lift its drilling utilisation to 8 rigs (from 7 rigs as at end- 3Q19), with another 8 rigs still being stacked. Moving forward, SAPNRG is poised to start anew from FY20 onwards after the injection of fresh capital of RM4b from its capital raising efforts (consisting of rights issue with warrants and RCPS-i), which is expected to be concluded by end-Jan, while its 50% divestment of its E&P arm to OMV to raise up to c.USD800m is also targeted to be concluded by 1QFY20. All-in, this is expected to improve the company’s net-gearing to c.0.7x, from 1.7x as at end-3Q19. The improved post-FY20 outlook is further backed by the company’s display of healthy job flows recovery of late, which will only be further strengthened by its improved balance sheet and increased working capitals. With the overhang of its rights issue close to being cleared, we are turning increasingly bullish on the counter, underpinned by its (i) strong display of job flows recently, further backed by (ii) its improved balance sheet post-capital injection. Our   remains unchanged at  (implying 19% upside), pegged to 0.4x PBV – which is still over -1.5SD below its historical average PBV valuations. With that said, we see a more attractive entry opportunity to be after Jan-2019, once its rights issue has been fully completed. No changes were made to our FY19-20E numbers. Risks to our call include: (i) better-than-expected margins, (ii) slower- than-anticipated job wins, (iii) failures in job execution, and (iii) falling through of sale of E&P arm.

				","
		市场最近很明显缺乏信心，许多股市在进行附加股计划时，其权益无人问津，就算有，也以极低的价钱交易。 
		也许这给肯注资支持公司的小股东一个便宜买入的机会，但是事实上买了以后，股价是否跌得更厉害呢？没有人知道。 
		一些基金经理劝投资者持有现金，等市场大崩溃时才进场，问题是市场崩溃什么时候来临，也没有一个肯定的时间，希望许多现金的投资者心想事成。也希望支持公司募资计划的股东，在市场转好时可以赚到钱。 
		近来最糟糕的附加股计划，莫过于沙布拉能源（SAPNRG，5218 ，主板能源股）。其股价在除权前不幸跌破支持价30仙，目前在28至29仙游动。 
		由于其附加股定价在30仙，而优先附加股更在42仙，无疑的两者都没有直接买母股吸引，所以其白表格预料将只停在0.5仙，要卖的人很多都卖不出。 
		 
		 
		还好大股东愿意全面认购，否则，它的重组计划将面对很多的资金短缺问题。 
		再看同时期的NICE、纳音控股（NAIM）和麦克伦钢铁（MYCRON）的附加股白表格，和沙布拉能源白表格的命运一样，几乎都是待在0.5仙没什么交易，虽然是母股价钱不争气（比附加股售价还低），但是股东不卖账是主要的原因吧。 
		 
		 
		而上周结束交易的马面粉（MFLOUR）也一样，它推出附加股和债券计划，还送红股和凭单。 
		虽然公司除权后股价跌到50仙，不过其附加股和债券权益只在1仙-4.5仙交易，产生极大的价差。 
		按照附加股的建议，如果买入4股（售价50仙），将得到1红股和1免费凭单。 
		不把凭单算在内，我们买入附加股白表格（假设是3仙），认购4股的本钱是2.12令吉，可以得到5张母股（每股50仙，价值2.50令吉）。 
		这证明投资者不相信有这么好的交易，怀疑股价将在之后进一步调低。 
		问题是价钱还能再跌多少？这种价位是不是已经非常吸引人了呢？ 
		 
		2019年的股东大会本周有顶级手套（TOPGLOV）和成业资源（SYF），在1月8日举行。 
		而1月9日是KESM科技（KESM）的股东大会，这只股票的股价2018年惨跌，看来出席的小股东今年脸色不会好看到哪里去。 
		1月11日则是宝光（POHKONG）召开股东大会。

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Thu, 3 Jan 2019, 9:34 AM ",Oil & Gas - Rough Patch,,"Crude oil prices have displayed high volatilities of late, plunging below the USD60/barrelmark from a high of USD85 in Oct-2018. Going into 2019, we expect Brent crude to average at USD60/barrel, within a trading range of USD55-65/barrel. With oil prices at these lower levels, we expect job flows to come from the brownfield/opex-related space as new greenfield projects become less economically attractive. Under Petronas’ latest activity outlook, the oil major highlights possibly higher activities within the drilling, vessel chartering, maintenance and decommissioning space, benefiting players such as VELESTO, ALAM, PERDANA, ICON, SERBADK, DAYANG and UZMA. Meanwhile, our studies also have shown that during these times of volatility, a company’s underlying fundamentals (i.e. ROE) plays a greater importance in determining its trading valuations. Should sentiment/oil prices improve, our studies highlighted possible bottom-fishing opportunities in DAYANG, SAPNRG, MHB, and UZMA. However, given recent volatilities and uncertainties, with many names within the sector still plagued with balance sheet concerns and earnings instability, we still prefer to stick towards fundamentally more solid counters, i.e. DIALOG, SERBADK, YINSON, on top of staple Petronas names. Overall, we maintain NEUTRAL on the sector, with SERBADK as our top-pick given its commendable earnings growth delivery coupled with its superior ROE against its peers.  Oil prices have been showing signs of volatility of late, with the Brent plunging steeply by over 30% to breach below the USD60/barrel-mark after touching a high of >USD85/barrel in just October last year. While this may have help prompted OPEC+ to agree to a 1.2m barrels/day production cut in efforts to lift oil prices, there is still a greater sense of uncertainty lingering as fears of oversupply and deteriorating demand still remain at large, with oil prices still remaining sluggish even after OPEC+ announcing its output cuts. These are exacerbated by high U.S. crude inventories coupled with an expected slowdown in global economic growth moving forward. Meanwhile, Iran, Venezuela and Libya are being exempted from the OPEC+ cuts, while Qatar has also left the cartel in pursuit of its own natural gas agenda. Taking into account supply-side factors as well as an expected slowdown of global economic growth, we view 2019 Brent prices to average at around USD60/barrel, with an expected hovering range of USD55-65/barrel (down from previous forecasts of USD75 average).  Meanwhile, reading through Petronas’ Activity Outlook 2019- 2021, we see a likely increase in activities in the areas of: (i) drilling rigs and HWUs, (ii) marine vessels and barges, (iii) hook-up & commissioning (HUC) and maintenance, construction & modification (MCM), as well as (iv) decommissioning. Overall, we believe these could benefit local names which include (i) VELESTO on the back of increased drilling activities, (ii) vessel charters such as ALAM, PERDANA, ICON, (iii) maintenance players such as SERBADK, DAYANG, and (iv) UZMA with track record in decommissioning. That said, we also still believe cost pressures to still persists, and thus, there is still a need for service providers to remain competitive.  With 2018 being a volatile year for both crude oil and share prices, we noticed valuations for oil and gas counters to trade closer in tandem with its financial fundamentals, as opposed to more stable years previously e.g. 2013-2014. As such, we are led to believe that (i) in times of high uncertainty or volatility, fundaments (i.e. ROE) plays a far more important factor in determining a stock’s trading valuations than in times of more stable market sentiments/oil prices, and (ii) should market sentiment/oil prices revert positively, laggard players at lower valuations (and thus, lower ROEs) would display a higher re-rating than more fundamentally solid counters at higher valuations. That said, we identified possible laggard-play targets for bottomfishing to include: DAYANG, SAPNRG, MHB, UZMA, while names with more solid fundamentals would include: DIALOG, SERBADK, YINSON, and the staple few Petronas names.  seeing a possible pick-up in job flows to mainly come from the opex/brownfield-related space, benefiting local players such as DAYANG, UZMA, while local jobs may come in slower for fabricators, affecting players such as SAPNRG, MHB. Following our valuation-ROE study, we have made several tweaks to our calls and TPs (refer table below for more details). Overall, while some bottom-fishing opportunities may be present, many names within the sector is still plagued by balance sheet concerns and earnings instability. As such, we still find a need to be selective in terms of stock pick, preferring fundamentally more solid counters such as aforementioned DIALOG, SERBADK, YINSON, on top of staple Petronas names. Among them, we picked SERBADK as our favoured pick, on the back of its commendable track record of earnings growth delivery, coupled with its superior ROE against its peers. Source:   - 3 Jan 2019"

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Mon, 17 Dec 2018, 9:16 AM ",PublicInvest Research Headlines - 17 Dec 2018,Economy Markets MARKET UPDATE," US consumer spending gathered momentum in Nov as households bought furniture, electronics and a range of other goods, which could further allay fears of a significant slowdown in the American economy even as the outlook overseas continued to darken. The upbeat data from the Commerce Department on Friday bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for a fourth time this year at its Dec 18-19 policy meeting, despite moderating inflation and tighter financial market conditions. It also stood in stark contrast to reports from China showing a dramatic fall off in retail sales in the world’s second largest economy and from Europe where a key measure of business activity expanded at its slowest rate in four years. (Reuters)  US factory production was unchanged in Nov and the prior month’s reading was revised to a decline from a gain, a sign the industry may be taking a breather while still growing at a pace that supports economic growth. Factory output was unchanged after a 0.1% decrease that was revised from a 0.3% gain, Federal Reserve data showed. The results missed the Bloomberg survey median forecast for a 0.3% gain. Total industrial production, which also includes mines and utilities, increased 0.6% after a 0.2% drop that was also previously reported as an advance. (Bloomberg)  China’s Nov retail sales grew at their weakest pace since 2003 and industrial output rose the least in nearly three years as the economy lost further momentum, heaping pressure on Beijing to defuse its trade dispute with the US. The world’s second-largest economy has been losing momentum in recent quarters as a multi-year government campaign to curb shadow lending put increasing financial strains on companies in a blow to production and investment. The stresses on broad activity have been compounded by a sharp escalation in China’s trade row with the US, which has threatened to fracture global supply chains, chill investment, exports and growth. (Reuters)  Property investment in China picked up in Nov, in contrast to other key data where growth weakened sharply, though soft home sales and land purchases pointed to a dim outlook for the sector amid a slowing broader economy. Real estate investment, which mainly focuses on the residential sector but includes commercial and office space, rose 9.3% in Nov from a year earlier, accelerating from 7.7% in Oct, according to Reuters calculations based on data released by National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Also, China reported retail sales grew at their weakest pace since 2003 and industrial output rose the least in nearly three years in Nov. (Reuters)  China took more steps to defuse trade tensions with the US, confirming it will remove the retaliatory duty on automobiles imported from America and preparing to restart purchases of American corn. The 25% tariff imposed on vehicles as a tit-for-tat measure will be scrapped starting Jan. 1, the finance ministry said. China also may buy at least 3m metric tons of American corn, said people familiar with the discussions, who asked not to be named as the information is confidential. The moves come two weeks after President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping agreed to a truce in the trade war at their meeting in Argentina. Trump claimed he won a concession during talks with Xi and said China, the world’s biggest automobile market, would reduce and remove tariffs, a claim that Beijing didn’t immediately confirm. (Bloomberg)  Japan’s ruling coalition lawmakers said they will give tax breaks to car buyers to offset the impact of a sales tax hike planned for next year, amid the looming threat of steep tariffs on its auto exports to the US. In its annual tax code revisions, the ruling bloc also approved tax cuts on housing mortgages out of fear an increase in the sales tax from 8% to 10% planned for Oct 2019, could cause a slump in sales of big-ticket items. A series of tax breaks underscore Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s will to spend big to avoid a repeat of the economic downturn caused by the previous sales tax hike in April 2014, as he is putting fiscal reform on the backburner. (Reuters)  The BOJ is more likely to wait until after next year’s sales tax hike before taking action to tighten monetary policy, given increasing risks to the economic outlook and recent market turbulence, a growing number of economists say. All 49 of those surveyed by Bloomberg expect the central bank to leave policy unchanged at its Dec 19-20 meeting, with 88% of them forecasting the BOJ won’t raise its long-term interest rate before the end of 2019 compared with 78% in the previous poll. (Bloomberg)  Japan’s draft budget for fiscal 2019 will rise to a record of around JPY101.5trn (USD894.4bn) due to increased spending on welfare, public works and defense, government sources told Reuters. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government will issue around JPY32.7trn in new bonds to fund the budget, said two sources with direct knowledge of the matter. The government also expects around JPY62.5trn in tax revenue for the next fiscal year starting in April, said the sources, who declined to be identified because Abe’s Cabinet has not approved the budget yet. (Reuters)  Tenaga Nasional (TNB) will raise the imbalance cost pass-through (ICPT) surcharge for non household users from March 1 to June 30 next year, to help offset rising costs. The ICPT surcharge will increase to 2.55 sen per kWh from the current 1.35 sen per kWh, following the government's approval for the national utility company to continue implementing the ICPT mechanism for another six months, from Jan 1 to June 30, 2019. However, the ICPT surcharge for household users will remain unchanged, TNB said. (The Edge)  Sapura Energy announced late tonight that its single largest shareholder Tan Sri Shahril Shamsuddin, who is also the president and CEO, has decided to put in an additional RM100m to subscribe in full the rights issue that is sweetened with free warrants. Sapura received irrevocable undertaking from its direct substantial shareholder Sapura Technology for RM400m worth of rights shares, and from Jurudata SB. (The Edge)  Petronas Chemicals Group unit has inked a deal to market methanol produced by a Sarawak state-owned company. Petronas Chemicals Marketing (Labuan) Ltd will act as the marketing arm for Sarawak Petchem SB for methanol from the latter's plant in Bintulu for 20 years, with the option for further extension. (The Edge)  YFG has received a termination letter from Atta Global Group unit Atta Properties SB to stop construction works for a RM40m project on Jalan Sultan Azlan Shah, Penang. The notice of termination was served to its wholly-owned subsidiary YFG Engineering SB owing to some legal and financial issues, which currently affect the progress and sub-contractor of the project on the part of Atta Properties. (The Edge) Tan Chong Motor Holdings is set to lose its right to import and distribute Nissan vehicles and parts in Vietnam with effect from Sept 10 next year. Nissan Motor Co Ltd last week issued a notice of termination of its joint venture (JV) agreement with Tan Chong's wholly-owned subsidiary, ETCM (V) Pte Ltd, without stating a reason. (The Edge)  Chemical Company of Malaysia (CCM) said Indonesia's tax court has ruled in favour of its unit in its appeals over taxes imposed. Several tax adjustments were made by the tax auditor, amounting to R34.06bn (RM9.78m) or 99.25% of the total appealed amount of R34.31bn (RM9.85m). (The Edge) US markets felt the heat of weaker-than-expected economic numbers coming out of China and Europe, as growth-related concerns resurfaced. All three key benchmarks slumped last Friday, with the Nasdaq Composite underperforming with a 2.3% loss. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 fell 2.0% and 1.9% meanwhile. China reported industrial output and retail sales growth numbers for November that missed expectations, another sign that its economy may be slowing down. Over in Europe, the release of weaker-than-expected forecasts weighed on sentiment. IHS Markit’s Flash Eurozone PMI fell to 51.7 in December, its lowest level in 4 years. The commentary released – new business inflows almost stalled, job creation slipped to a two year low and business optimism deteriorated, is disconcerting. France’s benchmark CAC 40 was the weakest amongst the major markets, down 0.9% on the day. Elsewhere, Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.7% as Germany’s DAX, UK’s FTSE 100 and Spain’s IBEX 35 all slipped 0.5%. Asian markets were unsurprisingly lower earlier in the day as China’s weak data deepened worries over global growth. The Bank of Japan released its closely-watched Tankan survey which showed confidence among large Japanese manufacturers remaining steady in December compared to three months ago, though this was insufficient to prevent the Nikkei 225 from falling 2.0%. The Shanghai Composite and Hang Seng indices declined 1.5% and 1.6% as the Straits Times Index and FBM KLCI fell 1.1% and 0.8%. Tan Chong Motor Holdings said it is set to lose its right to import and distribute Nissan vehicles and parts in Vietnam with effect from Sept 10 next year.

	Analysts said Sapura Energy's future income is already locked in due to its long term contracts and the prospects of better crude oil prices. 
	  
	""Sapura Energy is poised for brighter skies now that it has received a vote of confidence from state-owned fund and asset manager PNB. 
	  
	""On top of that, Sapura is in the good hands of its president and chief executive officer Tan Sri Shahril Shamsuddin who has vast experience in the oil and gas sector able to steer the company to greater heights,"" said a Maybank Investment analyst. 
	  
	The analyst added Sapura Energy has nowhere to go but up due to its fat order book of more than RM18 billion and will also be able to ride over the challenging times as crude oil prices are still good at current levels and it will be still be able to register a decent profit. 
	  
	He added PNB manages assets and investments worth more than RM80 billion and by increasing its stake in Sapura Energy, it demonstrates PNB's growing confidence in Shahril as well as Sapura Energy's future income growth. 
	  
	""Sapura Energy is now in the right growth trajectory and is poised for recovery in tandem with the world's robust energy sector as well as recovering crude oil prices,"" said the analyst. 
	  
	Sapura Energy received shareholders nod at its extraordinary general meeting last week to raise RM4 billion via a cash call exercise.

	""Once oil prices surge, Sapura Energy together with PNB will be able to reap the profits of higher oil prices which 
	will bolster their earnings.” 
	  
	He added PNB has been known in the past to venture into oil and gas companies by buying up stakes in oil and gas firms but the equity has always been relatively small to medium in investment value.

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Sat, 15 Dec 2018, 2:58 AM ","Sapura seals OMV deal, eyes turnaround in FY2020",,"
				WITH Sapura Energy Bhd sealing a strategic partnership with OMV Aktiengesellschaft (OMV) last Friday, the oil and gas services and solutions provider is now eyeing a turnaround in the financial year ending Jan 31, 2020 (FY2020). 
				This is also pending the success of the RM4 billion cash call Sapura Energy is currently undertaking. Both exercises would pare Sapura Energy’s debt by some RM7 billion, reducing its interest costs by about RM320 million annually, allowing it to focus on its growth prospects. 
				Sapura’s order book now stands at slightly above RM16 billion across three years, says CEO Tan Sri Shahril Shamsuddin. “Our order book will increase significantly in the coming months,” he says, amid expectations of new contracts from the Middle East, India and South and Central America. 
				“It is the execution of these works from engineering and construction that will help the company turn around next year,” he tells reporters after sealing the deal for Sapura Energy to divest half of its wholly-owned exploration and production (E&P) unit Sapura Upstream Sdn Bhd to Austrian integrated oil and gas group OMV. 
				The deal involves a joint venture between Sapura Energy and OMV, following a heads of agreement signed on Sept 12. 
				Recall that Sapura Upstream’s enterprise value was reported at US$1.6 billion in September. From the tie-up, Sapura Energy will receive proceeds of between US$945 million and US$975 million, representing a gain on disposal of US$619 million to US$649 million. 
				The deal entails OMV subscribing to 50% of the enlarged issued share capital of Sapura Upstream — to be renamed Sapura OMV Upstream — for US$540 million, with the remaining 50% held by Sapura Energy. 
				OMV also agrees to repay US$350 million worth of shareholders’ loans owed by Sapura Upstream to Sapura Energy, plus an additional consideration of US$55 million as well as contingency funds of up to US$30 million in relation to Sapura Energy’s Block 30 exploration asset in Mexico. 
				Minus the funds tied to the Mexican asset, Sapura Energy will have US$890 million cash, of which US$720 million (about RM3 billion) will partly be used to repay its debt. Another US$160 million will be reserved for working capital after excluding about US$10 million required for the exercise. 
				Sapura Energy has long- and short-term borrowings of RM11.12 billion and RM5.76 billion respectively as at end-July. On top of Sapura Energy’s recent RM4 billion rights issue, the company will be able to pare its debts by RM7 billion to RM9.88 billion. 
				On the tie-up, Shahril says: “We could not have got from a listing [of Sapura Upstream] neither the price [offered by OMV] nor the [prospects of] development of the companies and the human capital involved. 
				“The JV, with the injection of new capital and capabilities of a new partner, will probably be bigger and will generate more cash than if Sapura Energy were to do it alone.” The two partners currently share an average cash flow break-even of about US$25 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe). 
				OMV is an integrated O&G outfit with a footprint in Russia, Europe, the Middle East, Australasia and Africa, with proven reserves of 1.15 billion boe and average daily production of 348,000 boe/d in 2017. 
				The Austrian outfit will fully consolidate Sapura OMV Upstream’s assets in its financial statements. This comprises 260 million boe in proven and probable reserves and contingent reserves, which will no longer appear in Sapura Energy’s books. Sapura Energy’s Sabah exploration assets are carved out from the strategic partnership OMV deputy chairman Johann Pleininger calls Sapura Upstream’s SK408 fields off Sarawak, which has proven natural gas reserves of nine trillion cubic feet as the JV company’s “most valuable asset”. 
				He reveals that Sapura Energy came out tops after screening 1,700 assets and 500 companies in OMV’s search for a “partner of choice”. 
				Referring to SK408, Pleininger says, “What we are aiming for is to triple the production in the next two years from close to 10,000 boe/d currently to 30,000 boe/d in 2020, and then we want to double to up to 70,000 boe/d in just entitlement production by 2023,” he adds. 
				“So we have a great company, great assets, and a country where we are welcomed and we will invest in. Sapura is a partner of choice.” 
				In the long run, the JV company is set to become one of the largest Asian independent O&G outfits in terms of reserves that will focus on “where the markets of the future will be” namely Asia Pacific, in particular Southeast Asia, India and China. 
				“We are committed to stay long term in Malaysia for the coming decades,” says Pleininger. “OMV is cash-rich; it is a cash machine. We hope to also turn Sapura OMV Upstream into a cash machine in the coming years,” he adds. 
				Shares of Sapura Energy rose 1.5 sen or 4.17% to close at 38 sen on Friday, giving the company a market capitalisation of RM2.25 billion. 
				The current share price level, says Shahril, is “very good” for the rights issue. “I think the market is looking at how we are going to bring down our debt …  and now [at post-exercise levels] it is a very, very strong balance sheet. 
				“And I believe you will see a better valuation closer to its intrinsic value [considering the] cash-generation capabilities in the coming years,” he says.

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Sat, 15 Dec 2018, 2:55 AM ","With RM4 bil from shareholders, can Shahril turn things around at Sapura Energy?",,"
	KUALA LUMPUR: With RM4 billion coming from the recently approved rights issue that will raise about RM4 billion to pare down debts, Tan Sri Shahril Shamsuddin, president and CEO of the company of Sapura Energy Bhd is confident of turning the group around. 
	Last week, Sapura Energy announced that its units Sapura Fabrication Sdn Bhd and Sapura Saudi Arabia had been selected by the Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco) for a Long-Term Agreement (LTA) programme, which would enable Sapura Energy to secure engineering, procurement, fabrication, transportation and installation (EPCI) contracts to support Saudi Aramco’s offshore projects, which could be a lucrative proposal. 
	Also, Sapura Energy announced last month the sale of a 50% stake in its exploration and production unit for possibly US$800 million or RM3.32 billion in cash to Austrian stalwart OMV Aktiengesellschaft. 
	It would seem that things are looking promising for the oil and gas group again. 
	In fact, Shahril has said that Sapura Energy would turn the corner by financial year ending Jan 31, 2020. This comes after the company suffered a RM2.50 billion net loss from RM5.89 billion in revenue for its year ended January 2018.

	Meanwhile, an analyst at a local brokerage said other international investors would have no qualms to tie up with Sapura in the future knowing that the company is steadfastly backed by PNB. 
	  
	""Other investors would not hesitate to invest in Sapura Energy in the future as the PNB brand is already a strong endorsement erasing any doubts investors have on the company's capability to grow,"" said the analyst."
5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Wed, 12 Dec 2018, 4:19 PM ","Shahril who run business RM200,000 survives ouster move",,"
	PRESIDENT and CEO of Sapura Energy Bhd Tan Sri Shahril Shamsuddin was visibly pleased when The Edge met him last week. His enthusiasm is understandable. 
	The oil and gas services provider, in which Shahril has 16.8% equity interest, had just announced that Austrian oil and gas giant OMV Aktiengesellschaft was seeking to acquire a 50% stake in the group’s upstream assets housed under Sapura Upstream Sdn Bhd (previously known as Sapura Exploration and Production Sdn Bhd). 
	The parties have signed a heads of agreement and are ironing out the details. 
	The pricing of the stake is based on an enterprise value of US$1.6 billion (RM6.64 billion), which means Sapura Energy will soon have US$800 million fresh cash — something that the group needs to deleverage its debt-heavy balance sheet. 
	On top of that, Sapura Energy will have a strong partner to grow its upstream business. 
	The enterprise value of Sapura Upstream is a stark contrast to Sapura Energy’s market capitalisation of RM2.6 billion. 
	Sapura Energy’s share price saw a strong rebound after the announcement. During the three trading days last week, the stock gained 30% to close at 45.5 sen on Friday. A total of 1.12 billion shares changed hands during the holiday-shortened week. 
	The climb in share price spells investor confidence in the deal, considering that the counter had been hammered down to an all-time low of 33.5 sen right after the announcement of its massive RM4 billion cash call last month. 
	“It’s a good deal … I can challenge anyone who says otherwise,” Shahril tells The Edge. “It gives validity and is an endorsement of the company (Sapura Energy) …  equal shareholding to a company that has a market capitalisation of €15 billion.” 
	While Shahril is tight-lipped on the salient features of the agreement, The Edge understands that Sapura Energy may manage the joint venture. 
	He adds that Sapura Energy will be able to leverage OMV and vice versa, and that Sapura will have a presence in OMV’s strongholds. “There are also some aspects you can’t put a price tag on, such as knowledge, expertise, market reach and training. There is a wealth of knowledge and human resources that we can tap in our new partner,” he says. 
	In a press release, OMV chairman and CEO Rainer Seele says, “The intended partnership with Sapura Energy is a major step to develop OMV’s activities in Southeast Asia. The oil and gas demand in this region is expected to increase strongly until 2030 and OMV is taking the opportunity to further expand the business and build up the new core region.” 
	The stake sale will defer Sapura Energy’s plan to list its upstream assets that was slated for later this year. 
	“It [the stake sale] has more value add than an IPO. I see this as forming a partnership instead of just a divestment,” says Shahril, noting that there will be uncertainties along the listing process that range from valuation and tedious compliance to market sentiment and investor appetite. 
	 
	The name might not ring a bell in Malaysia but the oil and gas giant has a strong presence in Eastern Europe with a daily production of 348,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day, which is evenly split between oil and gas, with more than half of the production coming from Romania and Austria. OMV has a workforce of 20,721. 
	For its financial year ended Dec 31, 2017, OMV chalked up €1.59 billion in net profit (RM7.66 billion) from €20.22 billion (RM97.37 billion) in revenue. Last Thursday, its shares closed at €45.92 (RM221.37), giving it a market capitalisation of €15.02 billion (RM72.33 billion). 
	OMV’s upstream arm explores and produces oil and gas in Central and Eastern Europe, the North Sea, the Middle East, Africa, Russia and Australasia. 
	As at end-2017, OMV had proven reserves of 1.15 billion BOE and proven and probable reserves of 1.94 billion BOE. Its downstream business includes three refineries in Austria, Germany and Romania, an international multi-brand filling station retail network and a processing capacity of 17.8 million tonnes. OMV also has an Austrian gas pipeline network and storage facilities. 
	Its largest shareholders are Österreichische Bundes- und Industriebeteiligungen GmbH, which represents the Austrian government and holds a 31.5% stake, and International Petroleum Investment Company, which has 24.9%. 
	 
	The deal came as  a surprise to the investing fraternity but thus far, most analysts and fund managers seem positive about it simply because the stake sale gives much more assurance on Sapura Energy’s plan to monetise assets to pare down its debt, compared with a listing exercise. 
	“The divestment has fewer uncertainties compared with a listing exercise. Investors never like uncertainties,” says an analyst who tracks the stock. 
	Sapura Energy is expected to book a gain of as much as RM2 billion, if not more, which will boost its bottom line but not its core profit. 
	Apart from settling borrowings with the cash proceeds, Sapura Energy expects to transfer debts associated with the upstream assets to the company jointly-owned with OMV. 
	As at end-April, Sapura Energy had cash of RM1.36 billion, long-term debt of RM10.90 billion and short-term borrowing of RM5.57 billion. 
	Sapura Energy’s finance cost for the first three months of its financial year ended April was RM227.93 million. The company saw a net loss of RM136.73 million from RM1.05 billion in revenue. 
	In a report, UBS says, “Based on the deal’s enterprise value, we estimate Sapura Energy could receive US$800 million or RM3.2 billion in cash. This should remove near-term financing concerns as it would allow Sapura Energy to repay its RM3.8 billion debt due in 2019, without relying on cash inflow from capital raising.” 
	UBS has a “buy” call on Sapura Energy and a 12-month target price of 52 sen, which is almost a 17% premium to the closing price of 44.5 sen last Thursday. 
	To recap, Sapura Energy announced a RM4 billion cash call involving a rights issue of Islamic convertible preference shares and new ordinary shares sweetened by free detachable warrants to pare down borrowings recently. 
	UBS adds, “We believe the successful rights issuance will be key to removing the financing overhang for Sapura Energy.” 
	Public Investment Bank expects Sapura Energy’s net gearing to drop to 0.7 times with total interest cost saving of about RM350 million. “As a result, the group’s bottom line for FY2020/FY2021 is expected to improve by more than 100% to about RM280.2 million and RM524.1 million respectively.” It has a “trading buy” call and target price of 81 sen on the stock. 
	Interest cost saving will free up more cash for working capital, which is essential for the group to execute jobs and secure new contracts. 
	 
	To an oil and gas man like Shahril, the deal that is expected to bring in over RM3 billion cash is akin to striking oil in a new well. 
	Sapura Energy has put in place two major plans to slash its debt —divesting a 50% stake in an upstream unit and a rights issue — in a short span of four weeks. Should things pan out, its debt problem will soon be a thing of the past. 
	In fact, Shahril is already looking beyond the concerns about the group’s large borrowings. “My work is not done yet. I have a different set of challenges now [after the group has addressed the debt problem],” Shahril says, noting that he needs to make sure Sapura Energy wins new jobs. 
	Sapura Energy’s order book is gaining traction at RM16.7 billion, after a three-year low of RM14.9 billion early this year. 
	According to CGS-CIMB, in Saudi Arabia, Sapura Energy is one of two or three contractors bidding for work at Saudi Aramco’s Marjan field. Sapura Energy is also bidding for US$950 million of contracts at ExxonMobil’s Neptune field offshore Romania. 
	It is also the leading bidder for the installation of the early production platform at the Mizton field, offshore Mexico, for Eni, and a strong contender for platform fabrication and installation work at ONGC’s KG-DWN-98/2 project in India. 
	The steady climb in crude oil prices, which has breached the US$70 level, might be a signal that the industry will be out of the woods soon, if it is not already. 
	The stage seems set for Shahril, one of the most highly paid CEOs on Bursa Malaysia, to prove that his strategy to expand the group via borrowings can bring it to greater heights."

	Malaysian-based oil and gas service company, Sapura Energy Berhad, has shown great environmental initiative following their annual ‘Save the Turtles’ programme. 
	 
	  
	  
	  
	 
	  
	Collaborating with the Department of Fisheries of Perak, the programme aimed to promote the conservation of seas turtles through stabilising and increasing sea turtle population. 
	The programme was held at the Turtle Conservation and Information Centre (TCIC) in Lumut with 40 volunteer employees from Sapura Energy donating their time to the cause. 
	The volunteers relocated over 100 fresh sea turtle eggs to a new hatchery nest named “Sapura Energy” and released over 40 baby turtles into the sea. 
	The programme also involves volunteers also taking part in “gotong-royong” activities at the Turtle Conversation and Information Centre which include cleaning up the pool, beach and surrounding areas for a cleaner, healthier environment. 
	The Save the Turtles programme contributed towards Sapura Energy’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) environment initiative. 
	Sapura Energy are constantly working towards improving environmental outcomes through sustainable methods and collaborations with local organisations. 
	This years’ Save the Turtle programme follows the success of last years’ in November. 
	Malaysia hosts four of the seven species of sea turtles in their waters including Leatherback, Green, Hawksbill, and Olive ridley turtles, all listed as endangered species.

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Tue, 11 Dec 2018, 8:32 PM ",Sapura seals deal to divest 50% upstream unit to OMV AG for up to US$975m,,"
	KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 9): Sapura Energy Bhd has sealed the deal to divest half of its wholly-owned exploration and production (E&P) unit Sapura Upstream Sdn Bhd to Austrian oil and gas (O&G) outfit OMV Aktiengesellschaft (OMV), of which part of the proceeds will be used to repay its debt. 
	Sapura and OMV inked a joint venture (JV) agreement for the strategic partnership today, as a follow-up to a Heads of Agreement (HoA) signed between the two parties on Sept 12. 
	The deal entails OMV subscribing to 50% of the enlarged issued share capital of Sapura Upstream for US$540 million, and to repay US$350 million worth of shareholders’ loan owed by Sapura Upstream to Sapura Energy. 
	This marks a cash consideration of US$890 million to Sapura Energy, of which US$720 million (RM3 billion) will partly be used to repay its debt. Another US$160 million will be reserved for working capital after discarding funds required for the exercise. 
	Sapura Energy has long- and short-term borrowings of RM11.12 billion and RM5.76 billion respectively as at end-July. On top of Sapura Energy’s recent RM4 billion rights issue, the company will be able to pare about RM7 billion in debt to RM9.88 billion. 
	OMV also agreed for an additional consideration worth US$55 million plus up to another US$30 million in contingency funds mainly linked to the resource volume in Block 30, Mexico at the time of taking the final investment decision. 
	In total, Sapura Energy would receive minimum cash proceeds of between US$920 million and US$975 million, with a gain of disposal of approximately US$649 million, said the company. 
	Under the agreement, OMV will fully consolidate the JV company’s assets in its financial statements, which comprises 260 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) in proven and probable (2P) and contingent (2C) reserves, which will no longer appear in Sapura Energy's books. 
	It should be noted that Sapura Energy’s Sabah exploration assets is carved out from the strategic partnership. 
	In explaining the management structure of the newly-formed JV company Sapura OMV Upstream, Sapura Energy founder, president and group chief executive officer (CEO) Tan Sri Shahril Shamsuddin said he will be there as the chairman. 
	The CEO will also come from Sapura Energy, Shahril said. Meanwhile, the chief operations officer will be jointly appointed by Sapura Energy and OMV, while OMV will be appointing its chief financial officer. 
	“The union of these two companies brings about very good processes, capital, and enhances the technology that exists in both companies,” said Sharil. 
	“We have done this deal in a very short time...we realised in the early stages of the discussion that we were aligned in what we wanted to do with our companies and what we wanted to do in the region. 
	“This facilitated the progress and the rapid conclusion of this JV. We could not have got from a listing [of Sapura Upstream] neither the price [offered by OMV] nor the [prospects of] development of the companies and the human capital involved,” he added. 
	The vision, said Shahril, is for the JV company to become one of the largest Asian independent O&G outfits, adding that the exercise would also contribute to Sapura Energy’s vision to turn around by its financial year ending Jan 31, 2020 (FY20). 
	OMV is an integrated O&G outfit with footprints in Russia, Europe, the Middle East, Australia and New Zealand, with proven reserves of 1.15 billion barrels of oil equivalent and average daily production of 348,000 boe/d in 2017. 
	OMV AG deputy chairman Johann Pleininger said that the plan is to first invest in Malaysia before going to other countries in ""growth areas"" of the O&G industry as part of its Asian expansion strategy. 
	“We want to replicate our success story in OMV in recent years here in Malaysia together with Sapura Energy. We will give priority to Malaysia, we are committed to stay long-term for the upcoming decades. 
	It should be noted that Sapura Energy’s Sabah exploration assets is carved out from the strategic partnership. Despite that, among the assets that piques OMV’s interests include Sapura Upstream’s two natural gas E&P blocks in its SK408 fields offshore Sarawak which has proven reserves of 9 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of natural gas. 
	“Already right now, [the JV] has a great portfolio that is fit for growth. So what we are aiming for is to triple the production in the next two years from close to 10,000 boe/d currently to 30,000 boe/d in 2020,” said Pleininger. 
	“And then we want to double to up to 70,000 boe per day in just entitlement production by 2023. OMV is cash-rich, it is a cash machine. We hope to also turn Sapura OMV Upstream into a cash machine in the upcoming years,” he added. 
	Shares of Sapura Energy rose 1.5 sen or 4.17% to close at 38 sen today, giving the group a market capitalisation of RM2.25 billion."

Earnings were weaker >100% YTD, consistent with a 18.9% YTD decline in revenue to RM3.8bn during the period, mainly attributed to lower recognition from the E&C and drilling segments. Operational numbers remained positive nonetheless, with EBITDA of RM975.6m and margins at 25.6% in 9MFY19. Separately, the Group also announced that it has been awarded a contract for an Offshore Process Platform project which includes Central Processing Platform & Living Quarters for development of KG-DWN-98/2 NELP Block from Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited with a value of c. RM3bn. With SapE’s effective stake of 48.3% in a consortium with Afcons Infrastructure Limited, project value net to SapE would be around RM1.5bn. We are positive on this contract despite the relatively downbeat 9MFY19 results, as it will strengthen the Group’s presence in India besides providing further earnings visibility with outstanding orderbook now standing at RM18.6bn.

As a result, E&C returned to the black from losses of RM20.9m in 2QFY19 to RM39.6m in 3QFY19. The drilling segment saw an increase in the number of working rigs from 6 to 7 units qoq as SKD Berani commenced with its contract. We expect the narrowing losses trend to continue into 4QFY19 as seen in 3QFY19 when drilling division losses narrowed to RM11.7m qoq. The energy segment benefited from the higher oil price in 3QFY19, with the segment recording a 30.1% increase qoq in revenue, driven by the higher lifting price of US$79/bbl (2QFY19 prices US$77/bbl) as volume maintained at 1.1mmbbl qoq. In tandem with the higher oil price, this translated into a PBT increased from RM27.8m to RM37.1m qoq. SAPE and Afcons also announced a contract yesterday for the Offshore Process Platform project from ONGC to be completed by January 2021. This translates to RM1.47bn order book replenishment for SAPE based on its 48.3% stake in the JV company putting the YTD contract win to RM8.5bn. The recent EPCI Long-Term Agreement Programme between SAPE and Saudi Aramco would also be beneficial to the group’s long-term growth. Current outstanding order book stands at RM18.6bn.

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Fri, 7 Dec 2018, 8:50 AM ",Sapura Energy - Earnings Prospetcs Gradually Improving,,"Sapura Energy Bhd’s (SEB) 3QFY19 reported losses narrowed to -RM31.1m from –RM126m in 2QFY19 and -RM274.4m in 3QFY18. It also recorded a PBT of RM40.1m in 3QFY19 vs -RM209.7m in 3QFY18. This is largely attributable to higher revenue recognition of +19.3%yoy especially from both engineering and construction (E&C) and exploration and production (E&P) segments. Its cumulative 9MFY19 however widened to -RM262.5m (vs - RM217.9m in 3QFY18), which is below ours and consensus’ expectations despite the higher revenue due to three consecutive quarters of reported losses.  Segment revenue and profit climbed by +16.7%yoy and +235.0%yoy respectively. The higher revenue is attributable to higher activity levels while improvement in profit is in line with higher revenue recognized during the quarter and higher contribution from share of profit from associates and JVs during the quarter.  Segment revenue was lower marginally by -1.9%yoy. However, the segment’s losses have narrowed to -RM11.7m (from - RM81.5m in 3QFY18) due to the favourable impact from the lower depreciation costs in the current quarter as a result of the asset impairment exercise in 4QFY18. Seven rigs were in operations during the quarter with technical utilisation (uptime) of 99%. Moving forward, vessel utilisation rate are expected to increase to 50% rate in 2HFY19.  This segment remains profitable largely owing to upbeat global crude oil prices and aggressive efforts made into this segment. Revenue was higher by +42.6%yoy attributable to higher average selling prices (average USD79pb in 3QFY19 vs USD58pb in 3QFY18) while higher profit of +328.2%yoy is due to higher number of barrels of oil lifted during the quarter at 1.1mmboe in 3QFY19 vs 0.8mmboe in 3QFY18.  Further to the earnings announcement, SEB also announced that it has clinched another contract via a consortium where SEB holds a 48.33% stake in through its wholly-owned subsidiary Sapura Fabrication Sdn Bhd. The consortium will be undertaking engineering, procurement, construction, installation and commissioning (EPCIC) works for Central Processing Platform and Living Quarters for the KG-DWN 98/2NELP block. The block, which is located offshore the Godavari Delta on the east coast of India, covers an area of approximately 7,295 kilometres of the Krishna-Godavari basin with water depth ranging between 300 metres to 3,200 metres. The contract is awarded by Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) in India and is worth RM1.47b. The contract is expected to be completed by January 2021 which translates to an approximately RM300m in revenue recognition for SEB’s FY20-22 going forward.  Including the RM1.47b contract win announced yesterday, the group’s orderbook currently stands at RM18.6b. Out of these, approximately RM2.3b, RM6.0b and RM10.3b are expected to be recognised in FY19, FY20, FY21 onwards respectively. Out of the RM6.0b to be recognised in FY20, about RM3.8b will be from its E&C segment. The company’s bidbook is currently at USD8.8b with bid prospects at USD14.3b.  For FY19F and going into FY20F, we are expecting better performance due to the chunk of the group earnings will stem from the upbeat offshore activity levels of the E&C segment and sustainably higher crude oil prices of the E&P segment. About RM3.8b worth of revenue from the E&C segment is expected to be recognized in FY20F. In addition, we are also expecting increased utilization rate from the drilling side with the reactivation of Berani in 3QCY18 to serve Petronas Carigali and Sapura Alliance which began its 5+5 years contract with Shell in Brunei in 2QFY19.  We are reducing our FY19 earnings forecast to -RM116.1m due to the cumulative losses effect from the 9MFY19. However, we are maintaining our FY20 earnings forecasts at this juncture as we are expecting more meaningful earnings to be recognized next year due to the recent contract wins and pick-up in activity levels for both its E&C and E&P segment from FY20 onwards.  We note that the industry climate in general has been improving with crude oil price gradually improving to levels above USD60pb after recently plunging to below USD60pb, which we opine will continue to drive activity levels up especially for companies that have direct exposure to the upstream segments such as SEB. Management guided that even with the oil price at the current level; it is well above SEB’s break-even level. Although we acknowledge that Sapura Energy’s profitability might still be weak in the near term due to its underperforming drilling segment, however, we remain positive on SEB’s increasing orderbook replenishments; potential interest savings from paring down its borrowings as well as; the expected pick-up in activity levels for both its E&C and E&P segments. Furthermore, we are expecting to see a ramp-up in its activity levels as early as 1QCY19 as EPCIC contract works begin and yard utilisation will increase to 40% in 4QFY19 (from 10% currently) with more meaningful revenue recognition expected from 2QFY20 onwards. Yard utilisation is also expected to gradually increase to 80% with more works undertaken in the next six months. As such, we are maintaining our   call on Sapura Energy with a revised  (from RM1.01 per share previously). Our TP revision is premised on the enlarged SEB’s share base in relation to the expected completion of the rights issue and RCPT-i at the end of this month. Additionally, we continue to believe that the share offers short term trading opportunities for investors as we opine that earnings could start to surprise on the upside sooner-than-expected.

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Fri, 7 Dec 2018, 8:46 AM ",Sapura Energy Berhad - 9M19 In Line; New Contract Award,," SAPNRG recorded 9M19 net loss of RM292.9m, in-line with our expectations, making up 72% of our full- year loss forecasts. However, the results missed consensus loss forecasts of RM222.2m, which we believe was due overly optimistic expectations on its engineering and construction (E&C) segment. No dividends were announced, as expected. Cumulatively, 9M19 net loss widened 34% YoY, mainly dragged by lower E&C contribution (-83% YoY) due to lower jobs executed, partially offsetting: (i) narrowed losses from drilling segment (12%) from improved utilisation, and (ii) increased exploration and production (E&P) contribution from higher lifted volumes coupled with higher crude lifting prices. However, for the individual quarter of 3Q19, net loss narrowed 88% to RM31.1m YoY, similarly thanks to: (i) higher E&C contributions, (ii) narrowed drilling losses, and (iii) improved E&P contributions. Sequentially, net losses also narrowed 75% QoQ, with its E&C segment recovering from losses last quarter to record a segmental PBT of RM39.6m due to greater progress from jobs at hand. Meanwhile, drilling losses also similarly narrowed and E&P improved from higher lifting prices. In a separate Bursa filing, SAPNRG also announced that it and its consortium partner Afcons have been awarded an engineering, procurement, construction, installation and commissioning (EPCIC) contract for the Central Processing Platform (CPP) for KG-DWN 98/2 NELP block in India, by ONGC, with a total contract value of RM3b. Taking into account SAPNRG’s 48.3% stake, this would mean a net stake of RM1.47b from the contract, bringing YTD wins to RM8.5b and order book to RM18.6b – its highest in 3 years. We are positive on the contract win, as it (i) further reiterates its healthy contracts flow and commendable jobs execution record, and (ii) brought YTD wins to exceed our replenishment assumption of RM8b. We expect PBT margins for the contract to be at around mid-single digit percentage. Post-contract award, we revised our FY19-20E earnings upwards by 2-9% as we raised our replenishment assumption to RM9b. Although we are increasingly positive on its post-FY20 outlook, driven by: (i) fresh injection of capital from its recapitalisation exercise and 50%-stake disposal of its E&P arm, and (ii) high order-book and healthy contracts flow, we opt to maintain our MP call for now, as we see some overhang from its upcoming rights issue given high capital injection required from shareholders coupled with the highly diluted share base. Our cum/ex- is retained at  , pegged to 0.4x PBV. Risks to our call include: (i) better-than-expected margins, (ii) greater- than-anticipated job wins, and (iii) falling through of capital raising efforts. Source:   - 07 Dec 2018"

US and Chinese officials have been working for weeks on the contours of a possible deal for the two leaders to be announced following their dinner on Saturday on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires and a road map for talks to follow. Those discussions, according to people familiar with them, have centered on the possibility of a truce in which the US would delay ramping up tariffs on China in exchange for Chinese concessions. The two leaders would also agree on a “framework” for further talks, US officials such as Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross have said publicly. (Bloomberg)  Minutes from the Federal Reserve's monetary policy meeting held earlier this month are likely to reinforce expectations for another quarter-point increase in interest rates next month. The minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting said almost all participants agreed another increase in rates was ""likely to be warranted fairly soon."" The Fed noted a near-term rate hike would be dependent on incoming information on the labor market and inflation coming in line with or stronger than current expectations. (RTT)  Pending home sales in the US unexpectedly showed a substantial decrease in the month of Oct, according to a report released by the National Association of Realtors on Thursday. NAR said its pending home sales index plunged by 2.6% to 102.1 in Oct after climbing by 0.7% to an upwardly revised 104.8 in Sept. With the steep drop, the index fell to its lowest level since mid-2014. The sharp pullback surprised economists, who had expected pending home sales to rise by 0.5%, matching the increase originally reported for the previous month. (RTT)  Personal income and spending in the US both increased by more than anticipated in the month of Oct, according to a report released by the Commerce Department on Thursday. The Commerce Department said personal income climbed by 0.5% in Oct after edging up by 0.2% in Sept. Economists had expected income to rise by 0.4%. Disposable personal income also increased by 0.5% in Oct following a 0.2% uptick in Sept. Additionally, the report said personal spending advanced by 0.6% in Oct after rising by a revised 0.2% in the previous month. (RTT)  After reporting an unexpected uptick in first-time claims for US unemployment benefits in the previous week, the Labor Department released a report on Thursday showing another unexpected increase in initial jobless claims in the week ended Nov 24th. The report said initial jobless claims climbed to 234,000, an increase of 10,000 from the previous week's unrevised level of 224,000. Economists had expected jobless claims to edge down to 220,000. With another unexpected increase, jobless claims reached their highest level since hitting a matching figure in the week ended May 19th. The Labor Department said the less volatile four-week moving average rose to 223,250, an increase of 4,750 from the previous week's unrevised average of 218,500. (RTT)  Eurozone's economic sentiment weakened for an eleventh straight month in Nov, but the pace of decline was less than expected, helped by an improvement in morale in the industrial sector. The economic sentiment indicator fell to 109.5, which was the weakest reading since May 2017, when the score was 109, survey data from the European Commission showed on Thursday. The Oct reading was revised to 109.7 from 109.8. Economists had forecast a score of 109.1 for Nov. Meanwhile, the industrial confidence index rose to 3.4 from 3, which was in contrast to economists' expectations for a steep fall to 2.5. The measure climbed for the first time in five months. The services confidence measure was steady at 13.3 in Nov, which is the lowest level since June 2017. (RTT)  Germany's unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to a record low in Nov and the number of unemployed decreased more than expected, despite a weaker economy. The seasonally adjusted jobless rate dropped to 5% from 5.1% in Oct, figures from the Federal Employment Agency showed on Thursday. Economists had expected the rate to remain unchanged. The number of unemployed fell by 16,000 persons from the previous month, when it dropped 12,000 persons. Economists had expected a decline of 10,000. Earlier on Thursday, figures from the Federal Statistical Office showed that Germany's employment level in Oct hit a record high since reunification. The employment grew by 1.2% or 556,000 persons YoY to over 45.1m. (RTT)  China’s behemoth state-backed lenders are proving less responsive to the government’s call to boost lending to smaller businesses than local level banks. Outstanding loans to small and micro-sized enterprises by the five biggest commercial banks shrank in the first nine months of the year, while remaining the biggest single source of lending to the sector, according to data released recently by the banking and insurance regulator. City and rural lenders, which have a mandate to serve small firms, have so far been the main driver of the growth of SME loans. The data show that big banks remain risk averse despite of Beijing’s various measures to make small companies’ financing easier. (Bloomberg)  India’s economy is bracing for a slowdown as back-to-back interest rate hikes, a funding squeeze and weaker export demand start to bite. After breaking through the 8% mark to retain its position as the fastest growing major economy in the quarter through June, growth is forecast to have slowed to 7.5% in the three months through Sept, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists ahead of Friday’s data. An erratic monsoon, trade wobbles and tighter funding conditions after defaults by a shadow bank are seen to have weighed on output in the quarter. (Bloomberg)  Sapura Energy is mulling to either sell part of its drilling business as the rigs are currently under-utilised while it is also looking for partners. Its president and group CEO Tan Sri Shahril Shamsuddin said Sapura Energy was in talks with few parties to partner up for its drilling arm. “But the price must be right and it would open up to to new market and increase our competitiveness,” he said. Sapura Energy’s drilling arm is one of the group’s core business along with exploration and production (E&P) and engineering and construction (E&C). Shahril said Sapura Energy owns 16 drilling assets comprises eight semi-tender rigs and eight tender assist rigs. (StarBiz)  MyEG Service posted its first ever quarterly loss in the three month through Sept on impairment charges related to the abolishment of the goods and services tax (GST) regime. The company said it made a net loss of RM97.5m on revenue of RM138.3m. MyEG said its latest quarterly results were affected by impairment from an associate company amounting to RM95.45m and impairment of equipment amounting to RM76.29m. “The board wishes to clarify that necessary impairments have been made in FY18, on the investments as well as capital expenditure incurred on the tax monitoring system which were supposed to be rolled out under the GST regime,” it said.

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Thu, 29 Nov 2018, 10:47 AM ",Sapura Energy - Selected for LTAP With Saudi Aramco,INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS," Sapura Energy announced that it has been selected to join a long-term agreement (LTA) programme with Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco) via its wholly-owned subsidiary Sapura Fabrication Sdn. Bhd and Sapura Saudi Arabia.  The long-term agreement programme will allow Sapura Energy to participate in bids for engineering, procurement, fabrication, transportation and installation (EPCI) contracts to support Saudi Aramco’s offshore projects. The programme will be for a period of six years with the option for extensions.  With Sapura’s participation in this long-term programme with Saudi Aramco, we opine that it will open further inroads into penetrating the Middle East region. This is in line with Sapura’s ongoing effort of investing to open up new markets for the group. As of September 2018, Sapura Energy has invested approximately USD101.0b in Middle East. Currently, Sapura has minimal exposure in the Middle East with active bids for 14 projects worth approximately USD3.9b as of September 2018.  Total orderbook currently stands at RM18.0b, including the new contract wins of RM1.75b announced earlier this month. Out of these, approximately RM4.3b and RM4.6b are expected to be recognised in FY19 and FY20 respectively. The current contract wins-to-date constitutes of >50% of the past three-year cumulative contracts wins for SEB.  We are positive on Sapura’s entry into the long-term agreement programme with Saudi Aramco as we opine that this will open doors for future potential contract wins in the Middle East - which will potentially be earnings accretive to the company. Furthermore, we are expecting SEB’s earnings to gradually improve as the chunk of the group earnings will stem from the upbeat offshore activity levels of the E&C segment and sustainable crude oil prices of the E&P segment.  We are making no changes to our FY19-20F earnings forecasts at this juncture as there are no contracts that have been won or awarded arising from the long-term agreement at this point in time.  We note that the industry climate in general has been rather volatile with crude oil price declining to below USD60pb recently, a level last seen in November 2017. However, we expect the currect volatile crude oil price environment to gradually improve next year with OPEC ready to curtail production in 2019 and more visibilty on the trade war outcome between US and China. Although we acknowledge that Sapura Energy’s profitability might still be weak in the near term due to its underperforming drilling segment, however, we remain positive on SEB’s increasing orderbook replenishments; potential interest savings from paring down its borrowings as well as; the potential pick-up in activity levels for both its E&C and drilling segments. Additionally, we continue to believe that the share offers short term trading opportunities for investors. As such, we are maintaining our Trading  call on Sapura Energy with an unchanged er share.

The IMF downgraded its forecast for world growth last month, and recent data suggest the outlook has gotten worse since then, the fund said Wednesday in report ahead of the Group of 20 leaders’ summit this week in Buenos Aires. Financial conditions have tightened, especially in emerging markets, while trade tensions have increased, said IMF. Since the IMF’s latest World Economic Update on Oct 9, global stocks have slumped on concerns that rising interest rates and the US-China trade war could undermine growth. (Bloomberg)  Economic growth in the US was unrevised in the 3Q, according to the second reading released by the Commerce Department on Wednesday. The report said real GDP jumped by 3.5% in the 3Q, unrevised from the initial estimate and in line with economist estimates. Upward revisions to non residential fixed investment and private inventory investment were offset by downward revisions to consumer spending and state and local government spending. The Commerce Department said consumer spending surged up by 3.6% compared to the previously reported 4.0% spike. The downwardly revised consumer spending growth reflects a slowdown from the 3.8% jump in the 2Q. Overall GDP growth also slowed from the 4.2% increase in the 2Q, reflecting the slowdown in consumer spending growth as well as a downturn in exports and a deceleration in non-residential fixed investment. (RTT)  New home sales in the US showed a substantial decrease from an upwardly revised level in the month of Oct, according to a report released by the Commerce Department on Wednesday. The Commerce Department said new home sales plummeted by 8.9% to an annual rate of 533,000 in Oct from an upwardly revised rate of 597,000 in Sept. Economists had expected new home sales to rise to a rate of 575,000 from the 553,000 originally reported for the previous month.

It said the decision was made after considering the current challenging automotive market conditions in the Philippines. (The Edge) Comments : After almost two years delayed, we believe the proposed listing of its 60.4%-stake in BAP was scrapped due to slower consumer sentiment in the Philippines’ operations subsequent to the imposition of higher excise tax by the Government since early of the year. The potential IPO proceeds were meant to be utilised on the construction of warehouse, body paint facility and Mazda showrooms in Philippines. Nevertheless, we had not taken into account the proposed listing into our current earnings forecasts. Hence, we make no changes to our assumptions.

The contracts won are mainly for the provision of offshore engineering, procurement, construction, transportation and installation (EPCTI) as well as; provision for Pan Malaysia Underwater Services. With this latest wins, it brings Sapura’s total contract winsto-date to RM7.0b.  Sapura Energy via its wholly-owned subsidiary has secured an EPCTI contract from Hokchi Field Development in the Gulf Of Mexico with a water depth of 40 meters which is expected to be completed by the end of 1QCY20. Additionally, Sapura also secured another EPCTI contract from ENI Mexico S.de.R.L.de.C.V in the Gulf of Mexico with a maximum water depth of 40 meters which is to be completed by the end of 2QCY19.  Along with EPCTI contract wins, Sapura also announced it has been awarded a five-year contract to provide underwater services for Petroleum Arrangement Contractors (PACs), package C by four companies. These companies are: Sarawak Shell Bhd/ Sabah Shell Petroleum Company Ltd, Murphy Sarawak Oil Co. Ltd, Repsol Oil & Gas Malaysia Ltd and; Kebabangan Petroleum Operating Company Sdn Bhd. We understand that the scope of work for the contract consists of underwater services which includes the utilisation of vessels, air and saturation diving, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). The contract is expected to be completed by the end of 3QCY23.  Including the new contract wins of RM1.75b, the group total orderbook currently stands at RM18.0b. Out of these, approximately RM4.3b and RM4.6b are expected to be recognised in FY19 and FY20 respectively. The current contract wins-to-date constitutes of >50% of the past three-year cumulative contracts wins for SEB.  We are positive on the contract wins as we expect the company’s forward earnings to improve further, especially in light of the recently announced RM4.0b rights issue and disposal of 50% stake in Sapura Upstream which will further elevate its earnings with an expected annual interest savings of RM138m. Furthermore, we are expecting SEB’s earnings to gradually improve as the chunk of the group earnings will stem from the upbeat offshore activity levels of the E&C segment and sustainably higher crude oil prices of the E&P segment.  We are making no changes to our FY19-20F earnings forecasts at this juncture as most of the earnings from this new contract wins will only be recognized from CY20 onwards. Furthermore, we remain wary of SEB’s soft E&C and drilling segment activities which we opine will continue to be a drag on its earnings.  We note that the industry climate in general has been improving with crude oil price sustaining at levels above USD70pb, which we opine will continue to drive activity levels up especially for companies that have direct exposure to the upstream segments such as SEB. Although we acknowledge that Sapura Energy’s profitability might still be weak in the near term due to its underperforming drilling segment, however, we remain positive on SEB’s increasing orderbook replenishments; potential interest savings from paring down its borrowings as well as; the potential pick-up in activity levels for both its E&C and drilling segments. Additionally, we continue to believe that the share offers short term trading opportunities for investors. As such, we are maintaining our call on Sapura Energy with an unchanged  of  per share.

These include: (i) two engineering, procurement, construction, transportation and installation (EPCTI) contracts in the Gulf of Mexico, and (ii) four contracts for the provision of Pan Malaysia Underwater Services (refer table below for the detailed breakdown). Overall, we are positive on the contract wins as it highlights the company’s competitiveness in the market, as well as its jobs winning ability despite its worrying balance-sheet of late. In fact, these new wins lift the company’s order-book to RM18b – the highest in almost three years, and bringing YTD wins to a total of RM7b. We expect EBIT margins for these contracts to be within the range of 10-20%. Post-contract award, we tweaked our FY19-20E earnings forecasts by an additional 4-30%, after increasing our FY19 order-book replenishment assumption to RM8b (from RM5.5b previously). Moving forward, SAPNRG is poised to start anew from FY20 onwards after the injection of fresh capital amidst its capital raising efforts. Its recapitalisation exercise (consisting of rights issue with warrants and RCSP-i) to raise RM4b is deemed as an almost-guaranteed success, having secured underwriting support from PNB, Maybank and Credit Suisse, pending shareholders’ approvals in its upcoming EGM on 29 Nov 2018, while its 50% disposal of its E&P- arm to OMV to raise c.USD800m has also progressed to a definitive agreement (from heads of agreement previously), also subject to regulatory and shareholders’ approvals with target completion in 1QCY19. All-in, this is expected to improve its net gearing level to roughly 0.7x, from 1.7x as at end-2Q19. The improved post-FY20 outlook is further backed by the company’s display of healthy recovery in jobs flow of late, which can only be strengthened by its improved balance sheet and working capitals post-capital injection, while retaining its track record commendable jobs execution delivery. with an unchanged ex-rights (cum-TP of RM0.41), pegged to 0.4x PBV – close to -1.5SD of its mean. Despite the positive outlook from FY20 onwards, we still remain cautious over the stock for the immediate term, in anticipation of selling pressure should its rights issues are listed given the hefty capital outlay required – RM0.66 per existing share (RM0.50 for ordinary share rights and RM0.16 for RCPS-i), as well as the heavy share base dilution. That said, we see a more certain buying window after its ex- rights period. Risks to our call include: (i) better-than-expected margins, (ii) greater number of job wins than expected, and (iii) falling through of the group’s capital raising efforts.

Following the Heads of Agreement (HOA) announced by Sapura Energy (SEB) back in September for the proposed sale of fifty percent stake in its wholly-owned subsidiary Sapura Upstream to Austria’s OMV Aktiengesellschaft (OMV AG), SEB has announced last Friday that a definitive agreement has been signed between SEB and OMV with regards to the abovementioned exercise.  As a result of the disposal, SEB will be receiving up to a maximum of USD975m in cash. This translates to approximately RM4.056b – inclusive of USD350m in debt from Sapura Upstream; with RM2.7b to be recognised as gain from the disposal. RM3.0b will be used to pare down its debt while the remaining will be used to fund SEB’s working capital as well as to finance the cost of the transaction. Refer to Table 1 for the details on total proceeds and Table 2 for the use of proceeds. The exercise is expected to be completed in 1QCY19.  Should both the proposed rights issue of RM4.0b and this disposal go through where proceeds from both are channelled to repayment of borrowings, SEB’s total borrowings is expected to reduce to RM9.8b from RM17.2b in FY18. This will also result in SEB’s gearing declining to 0.62x from 1.74x currently. Additionally, SEB will also benefit from interest savings of about RM138.0m annually where average interest rate on its borrowings is currently at 4.6% per annum.  We are positive on this disposal as we expect the company’s forward earnings to improve further – in particular from savings in operating expenses. The company will also benefit from the reduced constrain on its cash attributable to the upstream business. Furthermore, we are expecting SEB’s earnings to gradually improve as the chunk of the group earnings will stem from the upbeat offshore activity levels of the E&C segment and sustainably higher crude oil prices of the E&P segment.  Group orderbook currently stands at RM16.9b, marking an inflection from FY18 low for the past four years. Out of these, approximately RM4.3b and RM4.6b are expected to be recognised in FY19 and FY20 respectively. The current contract wins-to-date constitutes of ~50% of the past three-year cumulative contracts wins for SEB. The company’s bidbook is at USD7.4b with bid prospects at USD10.8b.  We have incorporated the RM2.7b gain on disposal into our FY19F net profit. However, we are maintaining our FY19F normalised earnings at RM10.9m at this juncture. We are also making no changes to our FY20F earnings forecasts at this juncture as despite the potential annual interest savings from the corporate exercises, we remain wary of SEB’s soft E&C and drilling segment activities which we opine will continue to be a drag on its earnings.  We note that the industry climate in general has been improving with crude oil price sustaining at levels above USD70pb, which we opine will continue to drive activity levels up especially for companies that have direct exposure to the upstream segments such as SEB. Although we acknowledge that Sapura Energy’s profitability might still be weak in the near term due to its underperforming drilling segment, however, we remain positive on SEB’s increasing orderbook replenishments; potential interest savings from paring down its borrowings as well as; the potential pick-up in activity levels for both its E&C and drilling segments. Additionally, we continue to believe that the share offers short term trading opportunities for investors. As such, we are maintaining our call on Sapura Energy with an unchanged   per share.

With this move, we can see clearer direction for the Group’s upstream business moving forward, immediately eliminating the listing option of this segment as this is the better and quicker approach to improving its financial health. Moreover, this partnership enables SapE to strengthen its global presence in new markets via OMV AG’s existing global core regions in Romania and Austria. With a significantly improved balance sheet, SapE will now be able to undertake new and more valuable projects going forward. The sale is expected to be completed by the 1QCY19.

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Wed, 17 Oct 2018, 8:49 AM ",PublicInvest Research Headlines - 17 Oct 2018,Economy Markets Market Update," US job openings jumped to a record high in August, far outpacing a rise in hiring, suggesting that companies could be increasingly having difficulties finding qualified workers. The Labor Department said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, report on Tuesday that there were 7.14m unfilled positions in the economy in August. That was the highest level since the series started in 2000 and compared to 7.08m vacancies in July. The job openings rate also rose to an all-time high of 4.6% from 4.5% in July. Hiring increased to a record high 5.78m in August from 5.71m in the prior month. (Reuters)  Foreigners bought more than three times as much in US Treasuries in August than in the previous month, posting the largest inflow since June 2015, data from the Treasury Department showed on Tuesday. Data showed that purchases of US Treasuries totalled USD63.13bn in August, up from USD18.94bn the previous month. Treasury inflows were led by private investors, who bought USD55.57bn. Data also showed China’s Treasuries holdings declined to USD1.165trn in August, the lowest since June 2017, from USD1.171trn in July.. (Reuters)  US industrial production increased for a fourth straight month in September, boosted by gains in manufacturing and mining output, but momentum slowed sharply in the 3Q. The industrial production rose 0.3% percent last month after an unrevised 0.4% increase in August. Industrial output grew at a 3.3% annualized rate in the 3Q after accelerating at a 5.3% pace in the 2Q. The Fed said industrial output in September had been held down slightly by Hurricane Florence, which drenched South and North Carolina in mid-September. (Reuters)  The US is putting more distance between itself and the rest of the world in terms of growth expectations from professional investors. The news keeps getting worse for global economic prospects, with respondents to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Fund Manager Survey for October now holding their dimmest view for the future since the financial crisis. A record 85% of market pros say the world is in the ""late cycle"" period of growth. That's the highest reading since Nov 2008, just two months after Lehman Brothers collapsed and triggered the worst days of the Great Recession. (CNBC)  German investor morale darkened more than expected in October, a survey showed on Tuesday, as concerns about an escalating trade dispute between the US and China and fears of a hard Brexit clouded the outlook for Europe’s largest economy. The monthly survey showed economic sentiment among investors deteriorated to -24.7 from -10.6 in Sept. The US and China are locked in a bruising tit-for-tat tariffs dispute that threatens to hurt global growth as well as innocent bystander nations. (Reuters)  The euro area trade surplus increased in August on higher exports, figures from Eurostat showed Tuesday. The trade surplus rose to a seasonally adjusted EUR16.6bn from EUR12.6bn in July. Exports increased 2.1% MoM in August, while imports remained stable. At the same time, on an unadjusted basis, the trade surplus fell to EUR11.7bn from EUR15.3bn a year ago as the annual growth in imports exceeded the rise in exports. YoY, exports advanced 5.6% and imports climbed 8.4% in August. (RTT)  The UK unemployment rate remained at the lowest level in 43 years in the 3 months to August, helping the average earnings to increase further amid fears of no-deal Brexit. The ILO jobless rate came in at 4%, in line with expectations, and was the lowest since February 1975. The number of unemployed decreased 47,000 from the previous quarter to 1.36m. At the same time, the employment rate stood at 75.5% compared to 75.7% in the three months to May. Average weekly earnings excluding bonuses advanced 3.1% annually, the highest since late 2008. (RTT)  China's inflation rose to a 7-month high in September on higher energy prices. Consumer prices advanced 2.5% YoY in Sept, in line with expectations but faster than the 2.3% rise in August. This was the highest increase since last February. Nonetheless, inflation remains well below the government's full year target of around 3%. Food prices rose by 3.6% versus 1.7% a month ago. Meanwhile, non-food price inflation eased to 2.2% from 2.5%. At the same time, monthly consumer price inflation held steady at 0.7%. The upshot is that the recent rise in CPI is due to temporary disruptions to food supply. (RTT)  Bank Negara Malaysia has granted a conditional approval on Sapura Energy’s issuance of new Islamic redeemable convertible preference shares (RCPS-i) to non-resident shareholders. It said the central bank's approval is subject to the condition that the group is required to convert the proceeds raised from the rights issue of RCPS-i in stages for part repayment of foreign currency borrowings. (The Edge)  Barakah Offshore Petroleum and its unit, PBJV Group SB, have been granted an order by the High Court to restrain all proceedings and actions brought against itself except with leave of the High Court of Malaya and subject to any terms that the court may impose. It said the order was applied as part of proactive measures by Barakah to manage its debt levels. “The order allows the Barakah Group to negotiate terms with its lenders and creditors without having the threat of any proceedings and actions being brought against the company,” it said. (StarBiz)  Wegmans Holdings has proposed to undertake a bonus issue of 125m free warrants on the basis of one warrant for every four existing shares. The exercise price of the warrants has been fixed at 30 sen per warrant, Wegmans said. The entitlement date will be determined later, the filing said. Assuming full exercise of the warrants at the price of 30 sen each, it could raise maximum gross proceeds of RM37.5m. (The Edge)  Nextgreen Global had accepted a RM400m investment from Asia Capital Investment Fund (ACIF) to finance Nextgreen's Green Technology Park (GTP) projects in Malaysia. It said ACIF's RM400m investment comprises a subscription of 280m new cumulative redeemable preference shares (CRPS) in Nextgreen at RM1 each, and a RM120m loan. (The Edge)  Globaltec Formation has aborted its plan to collaborate with Hong Kong's EPI Energy Holdings Ltd to participate in the exploration and production activities of Globaltec's Indonesian unit. It cited failure to reach a mutual agreement on the commercial terms as reason for the termination of the MoU. ""We wish to announce that the MoU has been terminated in accordance to the expiration term of 45 days of the MoU,"" Globaltec said. ""The investment will enable the company to raise funds expeditiously, as compared to other forms of fundraising such as rights issue. This will allow the company to raise funds for its working capital for the project, without having to incur interest costs on the CRPS, as compared to bank borrowings or issuance of debt instruments,"" it said. (The Edge)  Tri-Mode System (M), through its wholly owned subsidiary Landbridge Haulage (M) SB has entered into a MoU with OGN Online SB. This platform operates under the name Kumoten. It said Landbridge Haulage had on July 12 signed an e-commerce logistics agreement with an established platform operator in Taiwan, HiClicks, for exclusive rights to operate the e-commerce logistics platform in Malaysia under HiClicks Malaysia. (StarBiz) might open higher today after reassuring earnings from the likes of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley helped instill a far more confident feel to US and European equity trading overnight following last week’s steep losses, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average all registering their biggest one-day gains since late March. Technology stocks — which suffered some of the sharpest falls during the sell-off — led the way higher on both sides of the Atlantic, while the US healthcare sector also moved higher after UnitedHealth’s results beat expectations. In Europe, Italian stocks and bonds outperformed after the government met a deadline to submit its draft budget to the European Commission. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both rose 2.2%, to 2,809 and 25,798 respectively, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 2.9%. The pan-European Stoxx 600 rose 1.6% as Frankfurt’s Xetra Dax rose 1.4%. London’s FTSE 100 ended 0.4% higher. Back home, the FBM KLCI index gained 8.10 points or 0.47% to 1,736.84 points on Tuesday. Trading volume decreased to 1.53bn worth RM1.62bn.Market breadth was negative with 339 gainers as compared to 439 losers. The regional market put in more mixed performances.

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Wed, 3 Oct 2018, 9:10 AM ",Oil & Gas - Contracts Flow Expected to Improve,,"Brent crude oil prices have been hovering at around the USD70-80/bbl level of late, up from the USD50/bbl level a year ago, on the back of OPEC-led production cuts and U.S. reimposing sanctions on Iran, while data has also shown that most of 2018 have been in a supply-deficit situation. All-in, we foresee oil averaging at around USD75/bbl for 2018-2019. However, this has yet to cascade down to contract flows towards local oil and gas players. YTD-Sept, 36 contracts were announced - staying flat compared to last year, and still vastly lower than 3-4 years ago. That said, we expect gradual recovery over the next 1-2 years as oil majors regain sufficient comfort in dishing out jobs. Naturally, top names that first come to mind would be companies with direct E&P exposure (e.g. SAPNRG, REACH, HIBISCS), while UZMA and DAYANG could also benefit from greater work orders from increased brownfield production. Meanwhile, YINSON should also be well-positioned to benefit from an improving FPSO market. Overall, we maintain our NEUTRAL view on the sector, albeit with some positive biasness. We select SERBADK as our top-pick, given its: (i) consistent earnings delivery, (ii) dynamic expansions into new regions, and (iii) superior ROE compared to peers.  OPEC-led collaborative production cuts have resulted in a more stabilised oil price environment, with Brent crude oil hovering at around the USD70-80/bbl level recently, as compared to around the USD50/bbl a year ago. While some declines in emerging market currencies earlier in the year may have contributed to increased concerns regarding the global economic growth, and hence, oil demand, this was offset by the re-stating of U.S. sanctions on Iran, leading to further supply-side constrains and driving crude prices to breach the USD80/bbl-mark in late-Aug to reach a four-year high. In fact, studying U.S. EIA’s supply and demand data, we found that oil production has mostly been in a supply-deficit (i.e. demand > supply) for most of 2018. From here, we may look towards the upcoming OPEC’s meeting in early-December, where we firmly believe OPEC would reiterate its stance of production-cut compliance. All-in, we foresee crude oil prices averaging at around USD75/bbl for 2018-2019.  Despite the stabilising oil prices, this has not been reflected in any strong recovery in contracts flow towards local oil & gas players. YTD-September, we have seen a total of 36 contracts were announced among local listed oil and gas players, identical to last year’s corresponding period. Comparatively, contracts flow was at >100 per year during 2013-2014 when oil prices were >USD100/bbl, and even in 2015 after the plunge of oil prices, 96 numbers of contract were announced. With all that said, we believe contracts flow should gradually recover over the next 1-2 years as oil majors regain sufficient comfort in dishing out jobs amidst the stabilising oil prices. More particularly, we expect to see an increase in work-order based contracts (e.g. maintenance or umbrellabasis contracts) as oil producers may choose to increase production in brown fields to immediately capitalise on the higher oil prices. Meanwhile, green field-based projects (e.g. exploration or new-oil production based jobs) could see a lagged surge given its huge capex nature and drawn-out planning process.  Naturally, top names that come to mind as immediate beneficiaries of a higher oil price environment include those with direct E&P exposures such as SAPNRG (MP, cum/ex-TP: RM0.41/RM0.34), REACH (Not Rated) and HIBISCS (Not Rated). Meanwhile, UZMA (OP, TP: RM1.65) could also benefit from its position in the well-intervention space should we see an increase in brown field production. In fact, based on our correlation study, UZMA has actually shown to have one of the more consistent positive correlations over 10-year, 5-year and 3-year periods among our oil and gas coverage universe. DAYANG (OP, TP: RM0.98) could also benefit from an increased number of maintenance work orders given that many of them have been deferred previously during times of low oil prices. Elsewhere in the green field space, we also favour YINSON (OP, TP: RM5.00) to benefit from an improving FPSO-market underpinned by the increased number of green field investments globally.  While we are leaning towards a slightly more positive outlook for the oil and gas sector, we have rationalised some of our calls during the recently-ended quarter, thus seeing 7 downgraded calls (out of 16 stocks) within our coverage. Several players are still saddled by debt-related issues (e.g. ALAM, ARMADA, SAPNRG), while some others are still expected to show volatile earnings for now. That said, postrationalisation, we are fairly confident in the remaining OUTPERFORM calls that we have, given that they are quality names with growth potentials and are backed by solid fundamentals. Among all, we have selected SERBADK (OP, TP: RM4.45) as our top-pick, given its: (i) promising growth and consistent earnings delivery, (ii) dynamic expansions into new regions through organic and inorganic growth, and (iii) superior ROE against many of its peers.

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Tue, 2 Oct 2018, 9:27 AM ","MQ Research: “SAPE at the Bottom, Looking Up”",Conclusion Impact Earnings and Target Price Revision Price Catalyst Action and Recommendation,"posted a net loss of RM126.0 mil. in the second quarter ended 31 July 2018.  This was lower compared to a net profit of RM28.9mil. achieved a year ago. To make sense of the results, Macquarie Equities Research (MQ Research) published a report yesterday with an updated target price of RM0.520. MQ Research expects short-term pressure on the share price to continue due to the short selling interest at the moment but believes that the sale of the exploration and production (E&P) business and additional orderbook wins will be the catalyst for SAPE.

This led us to cut our FY19 losses, but raised FY20-21E earnings as we impute in the interest savings from the proposed rights issue. Maintain  call with an unchanged  at  which has taken into account the changes earlier. E&C revenue increased 17.1% qoq in 2QFY19 attributed to higher engineering and procurement recognition, partly offset by lower vessel utilisation (fell from 50% in 1QFY19 to 33%). E&C returned into losses as margins contracted by 6ppts qoq. This will likely persist for several more quarters before construction work commences, which garner a higher margin. SAPE’s yard utilisation was relatively low at 10%, although likely to pick up towards 4QCY18 following Pegaga’s CPP first steel cut. 2QFY19 drilling losses narrowed by 15% in tandem with the higher revenue which rose 38% qoq underpinned by a higher number of operating rigs (5.8 rigs as compared to 4.4 rigs in 1QFY19). EBITDA margin however declined by 7ppts qoq. Drilling segment losses are expected to narrow in the near term as Sapura Berani commences contract in 3QCY18. Management has guided that prospects are improving with 10-12 of its rigs set to be tendered out, albeit timing is uncertain. SAPE benefited from improving global oil price as it realised a higher lifting price at US$77/bbl as compared to US$70/bbl in 1QFY19. This led to earnings increasing by 2-fold from RM9m to RM28m. Lifting volume was relatively unchanged at 1.12mbbl vs. 1.08mbbl previously. The YTD win of RM5.3bn has lifted current order book size to RM16.9bn. This current size would be able to sustain SAPE’s revenue at RM4.3bn/RM4.6bn in FY19-20E, inclusive of the Brazilian PLSV contract which is recognised under associate and JV line. Bids and prospects stood at US$7.4bn, with Middle East and Africa being a big market to exploit. Source:   - 1 Oct 2018"

This has widened its core net loss for 1HFY19 to RM309.5m as a result, which is largely below our and consensus expectations. Earnings were weaker >100% YoY, in line with a 32.4% YoY decline in revenue to RM2.3bn during the period, mainly attributed to lower activities and recognition from the E&C and drilling segments. Drilling remains as the main drag with utilization of less than 50%. Operational numbers remained positive nonetheless, with EBITDA of RM514.5m and margins at 22% in 1HFY19. We lower our FY19 forecasts to reflect the worse-than-expected 1HFY19 numbers. Our FY20/21 forecasts are largely unchanged however as we are projecting progress and contributions to improve. The share price continues to underperform (-42.3% YTD) especially after the announcement of RM4bn cash call, though partly cushioned by local institutions’ strong support to fully subscribe to their entitlements as well as on the potential stake sale in its E&P business. We maintain our   call on Sapura Energy with an unchanged FY20 sum-of-parts derived   as we believe that the Group is currently in positive transition toward improving its financial health, putting it in a position of growth. Our TP will however be lowered to RM0.46 post 50% divestment of its E&P stake and issuance of rights and RCPS-i, and RM0.38 upon full exercise of both RCPS-i and warrants. Source:   - 1 Oct 2018"
5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Mon, 1 Oct 2018, 9:42 AM ",Sapure Energy - Pick Up in Activity Levels to Fuel 2HFY19,INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS," Sapura Energy Bhd’s (SEB) 2QFY19 reported losses amounted to –RM126m. This is largely attributable to lower revenue recognition from both engineering and construction (E&C) and drilling segments. This brings its 1HFY19 losses to - RM262.5m, which is below ours and consensus’ expectations.  Segment revenue and profit declined by -38.2%yoy and ->100%yoy respectively. The lower revenue is attributable to lower activity levels while lower profit is due to lower revenue recognized during the quarter.  Segment revenue was lower by -9.0%yoy due mainly due to the unfavourable effects of weakening USD to MYR quarter-overquarter. However, the segment’s losses have narrowed to -RM58.3m (from -RM85.0m in 2QFY18) due to the favourable impact from the lower depreciation costs in the current quarter as a result of the asset impairment exercise in 4QFY18. The loss-making position for the segment was also led by lower vessel utilisation rate is at approximately 33% (with average of 5.8 vessels in operations) with technical utilisation (uptime) of 99%. Moving forward, vessel utilisation rate are expected to increase to 50% rate in 2HFY19.  This segment remains profitable largely owing to upbeat global crude oil prices and aggressive efforts made into this segment. Revenue was higher by +8.5%qoq attributable to higher average selling prices (average USD77pb in 2QFY19 vs USD70pb in 1QFY19) while higher profit of +210.7%qoq is due to higher number of barrels of oil lifted during the quarter at 1.12mmboe in 2QFY19 vs 1.08mmboe in 1QFY19.  Total group borrowings are expected to decline to approximately 0.7x post bonus issue from the current 1.69x as of July 2018. The bonus issue which is expected to complete in December 2018, will generate approximately RM4.0b for SEB. Management is expecting an interest savings of about RM400m annually once the borrowings have been pared down.  Group orderbook currently stands at RM16.9b, marking an inflection from FY18 low for the past four years. Out of these, approximately RM4.3b and RM4.6b are expected to be recognised in FY19 and FY20 respectively. The current contract wins-to-date constitutes of ~50% of the past three-year cumulative contracts wins for SEB. The company’s bidbook is at USD7.4b with bid prospects at USD10.8b.  Despite the reported losses largely stemming from the drilling segment, there is unlikely to be further impairments attributable to the drilling segment in the foreseeable future. However, management guided that should there be any potential future impairments, it will be more visible in 4QFY19. For FY19F in particular, we are expecting a better 2HFY19 performance due to the chunk of the group earnings will stem from the upbeat offshore activity levels of the E&C segment and sustainably higher crude oil prices of the E&P segment. In addition, we are also expecting increased utilization rate from the drilling side with the reactivation of Berani in 3QCY18 to serve Petronas Carigali and Sapura Alliance which began its 5+5 years contract with Shell in Brunei during the quarter.  We are reducing our FY19 earnings forecast to RM10.6m due to the cumulative losses effect from the 1HFY19. However, we are maintaining our FY20 earnings forecasts at this juncture as we are expecting more meaningful earnings to be recognized next year due to the recent contract wins and pick-up in activity levels.  We note that the industry climate in general has been improving with crude oil price sustaining at levels above USD70pb, which we opine will continue to drive activity levels up especially for companies that have direct exposure to the upstream segments such as SEB. Although we acknowledge that Sapura Energy’s profitability might still be weak in the near term due to its underperforming drilling segment, however, we remain positive on SEB’s increasing orderbook replenishments; potential interest savings from paring down its borrowings as well as; the expected pick-up in activity levels for both its E&C and drilling segments. Additionally, we continue to believe that the share offers short term trading opportunities for investors. As such, we are maintaining our  call on Sapura Energy with an unchanged  Source:   - 1 Oct 2018"

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Mon, 1 Oct 2018, 9:35 AM ",Sapura Energy Berhad - 1H19 Missed Expectations,," 1H19 net loss of RM261.8m missed expectations, coming in at 28% and 56% higher than our and consensus full-year losses forecasts, respectively. The mismatch was mainly attributed to its E&C segment, which plunged into losses of RM20.5m in 2Q19 (versus profit of RM126.7m in 2Q18, and RM36.5m in 1Q19). We were guided that this was a result of the segment being in a transitional period towards servicing newer contracts, hence lower asset utilisation (refer below for the breakdown of assets). That said, utilisation is expected to pick up in FY20 onwards once these contracts mature into later stages of progression. No dividends were declared this quarter, as expected.  1H19 plunged into losses from Core Net Profit of RM42.4m in 1H18, due to poorer performance across various segments: (i) E&C’s earnings dived 95% due to the aforementioned transitional period, causing lower utilisation, (ii) drilling losses widened by 98% on the back of lower rigs utilisation, and (iii) E&P earnings narrowed by 22%, despite higher volume production due to lower oil:gas mix (1 mmboe of oil is worth more than 1mmboe of gas), especially in 1Q19. Sequentially, 2Q19 net loss narrowed 7% QoQ, driven by: (i) E&P earnings jumping 3x QoQ from higher crude lifting price, (ii) drilling losses narrowed by 15% from improved rig utilisation, while offset by (iii) aforementioned losses in E&C segment.  Additionally, we understand that the 50% disposal of its E&P-arm (raising roughly RM3.3b) has also progressed into a binding principal sales agreement. The raised proceeds will be used to pare down borrowings, thus improving the company’s bids winning capabilities as well as providing working capital for jobs execution. All-in, we expect net-gearing to improve to around c.0.7x, from 1.7x as at end-2Q19. Meanwhile, the group has also secured YTD-contract wins of RM5.3b – the highest in the past three years, representing 48% of its FY16-18 contract wins combined, and bringing its latest order-book of RM16.9b.  Post-results, we widened FY19E loss assumption by 105%, while trimming 10% off FY20E earnings, accounting for lower contribution from E&C segment.  with an ex-all  (or RM0.41 on cum basis), pegged to 0.4x PBV of FY20E. Post-capital injection, outlook for FY20 and onwards is increasingly positive, driven by greater contract flows amidst improved financial positioning in a stable oil price environment. However, we still remain cautious for now, nonetheless, as the recapitalisation would, after all, still require a hefty capital injection by shareholders (RM0.66 per share – RM0.50 for rights, and RM0.16 for RCPS-i) coupled with the huge share base dilution. Risks to our call include: (i) better-than-expected margins, (ii) greater- than-anticipated job wins, and (iii) falling through of recapitalisation exercise. Source:   - 1 Oct 2018"

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Wed, 26 Sep 2018, 9:30 AM ",PublicInvest Research Headlines - 26 Sept 2018,Economy Markets Market Update," The Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this week and continue its quarterly drumbeat of 25-basis- point increases straight through to June 2019, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg. That’s a more aggressive pace for hikes over the coming months than Fed watchers anticipated in June, when they predicted the Federal Open Market Committee would skip a move at its Dec meeting. Such a pause won’t come until next Sept, economists now say. In a poll conducted Sept 18- 20, economists expected the upper boundary of the Fed’s target range for the federal funds rate to hit 3% in June 2019 and stay there until the 4Q, when they saw a third hike for the year. (Bloomberg)  Consumer confidence in the US unexpectedly saw a continued improvement in the month of Sept, according to a report released by the Conference Board on Tuesday. The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index climbed to 138.4 in Sept from an upwardly revised 134.7 in August. With the unexpected increase, the consumer confidence index reached a new 18-year high and is not far from the all time high of 144.7 reached in 2000. (RTT)  Home price gains in 20 US cities grew in July at the slowest pace in almost a year, a sign demand is increasingly bumping up against affordability constraints, according to S&P Core Logic Case-Shiller data released Tuesday. 20-city property values index increased 5.9% YoY, least since Aug 2017, after rising revised 6.4%. National home-price gauge rose 6% YoY. Seasonally adjusted 20-city index gained 0.1% MoM. July marked the fourth consecutive month that annual price gains in the 20- city index decelerated. (Bloomberg)  Borrowing by US companies to spend on capital investments rose 14% in August from a year earlier, a trade group representing capital equipment lenders said. The companies signed up for USD8.9bn in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, up from USD7.8bn a year earlier, the Equipment Leasing and Finance Association (ELFA) said. Washington-based ELFA, which reports economic activity for the USD1trn equipment finance sector, said credit approvals totaled 76.4% in August, up slightly from 76.2% in July. (Reuters)  Germany's wholesale price inflation accelerated in August largely driven by fuel cost, the Federal Statistical Office reported Tuesday. Wholesale price inflation rose to 3.8% in August from 3.6% in July. This was the fastest increase in wholesale prices since April 2017. Data showed that prices of solid fuels and petroleum products advanced 17.7% from last year. On a monthly basis, wholesale prices gained 0.3% in August, faster than July's 0.1% rise. (RTT)  French manufacturing sentiment deteriorated in Sept, survey results from the statistical office Insee showed Tuesday. The manufacturing sentiment index fell to 107 in Sept from 110 in August. This was the lowest score since March 2017 and well below forecast of 109. The balance of industrialists' opinion on their personal production expectations dropped again. The corresponding index declined sharply to 9 from 20. (RTT)  China’s central bank is expected to keep borrowing costs on hold through the end of this year despite further Federal Reserve rate hikes from this week, as economic growth slows and the trade war with the US gets worse. The interest rate on People’s Bank of China seven-day reverse repurchase agreements will stay at the current level of 2.55% through the end of the year, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of more than 40 traders and analysts. Fed policy makers are widely expected to authorize a quarter-point hike in their benchmark overnight interest rate in Washington on Wednesday and signal they are on track to complete another increase before the end of the year. (Bloomberg)  Japan's leading index fell less-than-estimated in July but reached its lowest score since late 2016, final data from the Cabinet Office showed Tuesday. The leading index, which measures the future economic activity, dropped to 103.9 in July from 104.6 in June. The reading was above the preliminary estimate of 103.5 but the lowest score since Nov 2016. At the same time, the coincident index that reflects the current economic activity, declined more-than-estimated to 116.1 from 116.9 a month ago. The flash reading was 116.3. The lagging index fell to 117.5 from 118.1 in the previous month. (RTT)  Sapura Energy has secured undertakings from its major shareholders in respect of its RM4bn cash call. PNB, along with its associated funds will subscribe to its full entitlement rights shares with warrants, and also excess shares with warrants not taken up. In addition, PNB has undertaken to subscribe in full to the Islamic redeemable convertible preference shares. (Bursa) Comments: We are not surprised with the news as PNB has already indicated via its letter dated 23 Aug that it would subscribe in full its entitlement as well as applying for excess that are not taken up. Upon completion of this corporate exercise, PNB will emerge as the largest single shareholder of Sapura Energy, having shareholdings of 40% versus 12.16% currently. We are positive on this news as it, signals strong support for the Group in turning around its fortunes and to embark on the next phase of growth on the back of improving industry conditions.

(The Edge)  OpenSys (M) will be rolling out more than 500 units of OKI Cash Recycling ATMs (CRMs) worth RM36 million at Public Bank, Bank Islam, RHB Bank and other major banks in the 3Q of this year. The latest development further cements its leadership position in the CRM market, with close to an 80% market share in Malaysia and more than 2,600 machines installed to date. CRMs are dual-function machines that merge the cash dispensing functions of ATMs and the cash deposit functions of CDMs. CRMs accept cash from depositors and dispense them to withdrawers, so cash is essentially 'recycled'. Banks can typically save between 25% and 30% in both capital expenditure and annual operational costs with the CRMs. (The Edge)  Sumatec Resources’ directors have been summoned by Bursa Malaysia to attend a training programme for the company’s failure to undertake proper assessment of its financial accounts which resulted in a large variance of 326.6% between its unaudited and audited figures. To recap, Sumatec Resources reported an unaudited profit of RM27.37m for the 4QFY16, which was in stark contrast to an audited loss of RM62.02m. The audited loss was due to provision for liabilities of RM71.41m and additional asset impairment of RM10.3m in accordance with the relevant accounting standards.

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Wed, 26 Sep 2018, 9:18 AM ",Sapura Energy Berhad - Capital Injection Provides Opportunity for Growth,INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS," Sapura Energy Berhad (SEB) announced that it has obtained firm support from its major shareholders i.e PNB and its associated funds (PNB) as well as; Sapura Technology Sdn Bhd (STSB) to subscribed to the RM4.0b rights issues announced late last month. The firm support is received via the means of letters of irrevocable undertaking for their proposed issuance of rights shares with free warrants and rights issue of Islamic redeemable convertible preference shares (RCPS-i).  PNB is expected to emerge as the largest single shareholder of SEB by holding 40% of the post-rights issue enlarged share capital. According to the irrevocable letter of undertaking, PNB will subscribe to its full entitlement of rights shares with warrants and excess shares with warrants not taken up of RM3.0b. In addition, PNB will also fully subscribe to the RM1.0b RCPS-i. Meanwhile, STSB will subscribe to the minimum of RM300m as announced earlier.  With the rights issue fully-subscribed, we opine that the capital injection will enable SEB to bid for higher-value contracts in key regions which will bring value-added earnings growth for the company.  These four contracts are worth RM815m in total which brings SEB’s new contract wins for the year to approximately RM5.3b which is within our orderbook replenishment expectations.  SEB’s total orderbook now amounts to RM17.5b. Out of these, approximately RM5.8b and RM3.3b are expected to be recognised in CY18 and CY19 respectively.  No change to our earnings estimates pending the results announcement due this week.  Sapura Energy’s share price has declined by approximately -65%ytd. This is despite stable crude oil prices in the tight range of USD70-80pb. We are of the opinion that the current broad-market sell off presents trading opportunities for investors seeking exposure in oil and gas service providers with direct upstream exposure. Although we acknowledge that Sapura Energy’s profitability might still be weak due to its other underperforming segment, we believe that the share offers short term trading opportunities for investors. As such, we are maintaining our Trading Buy call on Sapura Energy with an unchanged TP of RM1.01 per share. Source:   - 26 Sept 2018"

Of the contracts announced yesterday, we believe that the Pan Malaysia MCM contract from ExxonMobil to carry the largest value, with our guesstimate at around c.RM400m, although the actual value would be dependent on work orders issued as it is a call-out contract. Nonetheless, we are positive on the award as (i) we gathered that this is a re-engagement of SAPNRG by ExxonMobil in continuation of its prior maintenance contract awarded back in 2013, thus indicating its commendable job execution as well as client retention ability, while also (ii) providing additional jobs flow and earnings visibility. We expect EBIT margins within the range of 10-20%. Meanwhile, its gas pipeline contract from Saidel marks the group’s maiden entry into Nigeria, while offshore installation works for Quadrant Energy also marks its second contract win in Australia (maiden win in Australia were offshore exploration contracts by Finder Exploration, announcement dated 4 September 2018). While the individual values of the contracts were not disclosed, we are overall positive on the wins as it represents the group’s continued efforts to capturing new markets, while also highlighting the group’s ability to win contracts continuously amidst a competitive environment. We expect these two jobs to fetch EBIT margins at around c.15%. Elsewhere, extension of the drilling rig “Sapura Pelaut” would provide added utilisation visibility (currently c.99% utilisation) and some earnings clarity. These new contracts bring YTD wins to RM5.3b (approximately 32% of end-1Q19 order book of RM16.7b), which is still narrowly within our FY19E order book replenishment assumption of RM5.5b. As such, we are opting to make no changes to our current FY19-20E earnings forecasts for now, and also pending the release of its 2Q19 results later this week. Note that any further contract wins for the remainder of the year would theoretically warrant an earnings upgrade. with unchanged ex-TP of RM0.34 (cum-TP of RM0.41), pegged to 0.4x PBV. Our ascribed PBV valuation is still close to -1.5SD of its mean, as we remain cautious over its recapitalisation exercise given the hefty capital outlay required (RM0.66 per existing share – RM0.50 for rights, and RM0.16 for RCPS-i), coupled with the huge share base dilution (by 3.1x excluding warrants conversion). Risks to our call include: (i) better-than-expected margins, (ii) greater number of job wins than expected, and (iii) falling through of the group’s recapitalisation exercise.

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Thu, 13 Sep 2018, 10:49 AM ",Sapura Energy Berhad - Disposal of 50% in E&P Arm,,"Yesterday, SAPNRG announced that it has entered into a head of agreement for the proposed disposal of 50% of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sapura Upstream, which is understood to be the group’s exploration and production (E&P) arm, to OMV AG. OMV AG, one of Austria’s largest oil and gas company listed in the Vienna Stock Exchange, has a workforce of more than 20k employees and daily production of approximately 348k boe/day as in 2017. The transaction is based on an enterprise value of USD1.6b, and both parties have agreed to continue ongoing negotiations on an exclusive basis. Likewise, this also effectively suspends any ongoing spin-off listing efforts for SAPNRG’s E&P arm, pending completion of the negotiations. We were surprised by the group’s decision to go down the disposal route for its E&P arm given that they have always been guiding for a spin-off listing for capital raising. Nonetheless, we are positive on the valuation of USD1.6b (or approximately RM6.6b), implying a PBV of roughly 2x – which is on the higher-end of our estimated E&P listing valuation range of around 1-2x PBV. Nonetheless, we believe the capital raised will improve the group’s tender and order-book visibility as the added working capital would enhance the group’s prospects at job bidding. Post-disposal, SAPNRG’s book value is expected to be bumped up by an additional c.RM1.7b (or approximately 13% of FY19-20E ex-rights book value), thus implying an additional 4.0 sen upside from our current TP. Meanwhile, netgearing will also be improved to around c.0.7x, from an estimated c.0.8x post-rights issue or 1.6x as at end-1Q19. Based on our model, the move is expected to bump FY20E earnings by RM63m (or 32%), taking into account; (i) 50% loss of E&P earnings, contributing to lowered FY20E earnings by RM85m, while offset by (ii) interest savings from paring down of debt using the RM3.3b raised (50% of RM6.6b), resulting in a c.RM149m positive bottom-line impact (based on finance cost assumption of 4.5%). Nonetheless, given that no timeline was mentioned in the announcement, and the disposal is still under head of agreement (i.e. non-legally binding), we have opted to keep our FY19- 20E figures unchanged for now. Note that our current figures have already taken into account interests savings arising from the recently proposed recapitalisation exercise. Post-model update, we raised our exTP slightly to RM0.34, from RM0.33 previously, based on unchanged valuation of 0.4x PBV. While we believe the E&P disposal should serve as a positive share price catalyst, we remain cautious on the counter given the hefty capital outlay required by shareholders, as well as the huge share base dilution, arising from the recapitalisation exercise. That said, further rebound in share price would improve the likelihood of a successful rights issue, given that the rights issue price is at RM0.30.

The Commerce Department said construction spending inched up by 0.1% to an annual rate of USD1.315trn in July after falling by 0.8% to a revised rate of USD1.314trn in June. Economists had expected construction to rise by 0.5% compared to the 1.1% slump originally reported for the previous month. The modest increase in construction spending came as spending on public construction climbed by 0.7% to an annual rate of USD304.5bn. Compared to the same month a year ago, total construction spending in July was up by 5.8%. (RTT)  Activity in the US manufacturing sector unexpectedly grew at a faster rate in the month of August, according to a report released by the Institute for Supply Management on Tuesday. The ISM said its purchasing managers index climbed to 61.3 in August from 58.1 in July, with a reading above 50 indicating growth in the manufacturing sector. Economists had expected the index to dip to 57.7. The unexpected increase by the headline index came as the new orders jumped to 65.1 in August from 60.2 in July and the production index surged up to 63.3 from 58.5. (RTT)  The US economy is growing at a 4.7% annualized rate in the 3Q, the Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow forecast model showed on Tuesday, following the latest data on construction spending and factory activity. This was faster than the 4.1% GDP growth pace calculated by the regional Fed’s forecast program on Aug 30. The Atlanta Fed program raised its estimates on consumer spending growth in the third quarter to 3.6% from 3.0% and private fixed investment growth in the third quarter to 4.3% from 3.0%. (Reuters)  Eurozone producer price inflation accelerated on energy prices in July, figures from Eurostat showed Tuesday. Producer prices advanced 4% YoY in July, following a 3.6% rise in June. Prices were expected to gain 3.9% in July. Excluding energy, producer price inflation rose slightly to 1.7% from 1.6% a month ago. Among components, energy prices grew the most in July, up 10.7% after climbing 9.5% in June. Intermediate goods prices advanced 3.2% and capital goods prices rose 1.1%. While durable consumer goods prices increased 1.3%, non-durable consumer goods prices remained flat. (RTT)  UK construction activity expanded at the weakest pace in three months in August largely mirroring lack of new work on infrastructure projects, survey data from IHS Markit showed Tuesday. The IHS Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply construction PMI fell notably to 52.9 in August from July's 14-month peak of 55.8. The score was also below the expected 54.9. ""The sector is hovering too close for comfort to the no change mark which makes it a contender for more disappointment next month,"" Duncan Brock, group director at the CIPS, said. ""Though the path to Brexit is paved with good intentions, without significant progress the sector will soon be building castles in the air rather than on solid ground,"" Brock added. All three broad categories of construction activity registered a loss of momentum since the previous month. (RTT)  Mark Carney put the ball firmly in the Treasury’s court when it comes to his future at the Bank of England. The governor told lawmakers in London Tuesday that he would be open to extending his tenure for a second time to help the UK’s transition out of the EU. While he confirmed he’s discussed the issue with Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond, he stopped short of revealing more, including how much longer he might be prepared to serve. A Treasury official said that an announcement on Carney’s future will be made in “due course,’’ while a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said there would be news shortly and that he’s “doing a very good job.” Carney would be able to serve up to two more years than currently planned under the terms of his appointment. The Financial Times later reported that May has endorsed a plan for Carney to stay on until 2020.

Under the agreements, Sapura Upstream will acquire a 70% interest in the three exploration permits, and assume operatorship of the exploration, Sapura Energy said. Finder, which is based in West Perth, will retain the remaining 30% interest in the permits.

Group CEO Datuk Azmir Merican said the initiative to move to PBC, from the traditional input-based contracts, started one and a half years ago, noting that the method has been used in more developed markets. “The move to performance-based contracting, really allows us to start innovating and start saving money for our clients. We have started this journey and the ambition is to go full PBC in Jan 2019,” he said.

The contract was awarded to its wholly-owned unit, Pesona Metro SB, by Indo Aman Bina SB, which is a wholly-owned unit of TA Global and the project's employer. Pesona Metro said the proposed development comprises two blocks of serviced apartments at 33- storey and 28-storey each, carpark, and residential facilities. It said the 32-month project started on Aug 15 and will end on April 14, 2021.

Sunrise Manner is the registered owner of a parcel of development land in Bukit Mertajam, Penang and it will undertake a mixed property development project on the land comprising 51 units of double storey bungalow houses and 90 units of double storey “zero-lot” bungalows. The estimated development value for the project is RM544.17m. (SunBiz)  Borneo Aqua Harvest has proposed a bonus issue of up to 939m shares, on the basis of one bonus share for every existing share. “The proposed bonus issue shall be wholly capitalised from the share premium of the company,” the group said. This will involve between RM60.89m and RM93.9m being capitalised, leaving the group with a remaining share premium of between RM85.99m and RM119m. The group currently has an issued share capital of 608.88m shares, as well as 300m outstanding warrants and 30.12m outstanding options under its employee’s share option scheme. Assuming a maximum scenario, the group will have an enlarged share capital of 1.88bn shares, worth RM478.27m. (The Edge) US markets ended the day lower with investors’ nerves increasingly frayed over the country’s trade tensions with its major partners. Even as the US and Canada failed to reach a deal before last week’s self-imposed deadline and President Trump also saying there wasn’t a necessity to keep Canada in the new NAFTA deal, it’s been reported he stands ready to impose tariffs on another USD200bn worth of Chinese goods this week. There was some cheer on the economic front with the manufacturing PMI for August rising to 61.3 (July: 58.1) due to a jump in new orders, though insufficient to keep the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P500 from slipping 0.1% and 0.2% respectively. Over in Europe, most markets also ended lower on rising concerns over emerging markets’ vulnerabilities as a result of the various trade tensions. Basic resources-related stocks were the biggest losers on the day, the sector seen as hardest hit by US-China tensions. France’s CAC and Germany’s DAX tumbled 1.3% and 1.1% respectively while UK’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.6%. Italy’s FTSE MIB bucked regional trends to close 1.0% higher however. Asian markets traded listlessly but ending mostly higher amid continuing concerns about stability in emerging markets against the backdrop of rising trade tensions. Japan’s Nikkei 225 ended the day largely flat, though the Shanghai Composite and Hang Seng indices gained 1.1% and 0.9% respectively. IJM Corporation has secured an RM505m contract to construct and complete the superstructure works of Affin Bank’s new 47- storey corporate headquarters in the Tun Razak Exchange while Pesona Metro Holdings secured a contract worth RM264.3m to build two blocks of serviced apartments in Bandar Sri Damansara to round off a good day for contractors.

Sapura Technology Sdn Bhd, which owns 16.5% stake in Sapura has indicated to support the right for minimum amount of RM300m (10% of the rights) while another substantial shareholder, PNB with 12% stake also expressed its interest to underwrite, in which, the amount has yet to be determined. Bulk of the proceeds will be used to repay its debt which is due Feb next year. The proposed exercise is expected to be completed by end of this year subject to shareholders’ approval.  After imputing earnings savings, (i) FY19 net losses estimate is narrowed by 2% to RM264.0m and (ii) FY20-21 earnings forecast jumps by 9.8x (low base effect) and 62% to RM172.9m and RM411.2m respectively. On a fully diluted basis, FY20 EPS is adjusted upwards by 2.4x to 0.89 sen while FY21 EPS is diluted by 50% to 2.12 sen.      Three months subsequent to the announcement, we saw the share price plunge from c.RM0.70 all the way to the rights price and subsequently hovering around that level in the past one year. We believe the strong selling pressure on Velesto was mainly due to (i) continuous weak quarterly results announcement for 1Q17 and 2Q17, (ii) high impairment and (iii) lack of near term catalysts.  On a longer run, we reckon that the situation for Sapura could be better on the latter two arguments for Velesto. As the drilling segment is gradually picking, we do not anticipate significant impairment to the drilling assets at the end of year. Secondly, there might be further value unlocking should Sapura is able to list its E&P arm at an attractive valuation.   Source:   - 27 Aug 2018"

We are slightly surprised by this development as management had previously guided that it did not see the possibility of cash calls, though we think it was also inevitable due to its high debt levels amid current operating dynamics. Management has now reiterated the purpose of the proposal is to reduce borrowings so as to strengthen its balance sheet, enabling them to bid and undertake higher value projects globally. All said, this cash deal will dilute our SOP-derived TP to RM0.29 assuming full exercise of warrants, and RM0.25 upon full exercise of both RCPS-i and warrants. For the time being however, we are leaving our forecast and  of  unchanged pending completion of the exercise in 4QCY18 but caution for intense share price volatility and potentially further downside in the interim until clarity is seen in its longer term prospects.

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Mon, 27 Aug 2018, 9:47 AM ",Sapura Energy Berhad - Debt reduction by way of rights and RCPS-i issue,INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS," Sapura Energy Bhd announced corporate exercise involving two main undertakings: (i) 5-for-3 rights issue of up to 9.987b new shares and; (ii) 2-for-5 rights issue of up to 2.397b RCPS-i. The rights issue for the new share will have an issue price of RM0.30 per share while the implied conversion price of the RCPS-i is RM0.41 per share.  The main purpose of these corporate exercises is to raise approximately RM4b to reduce the group’s hefty borrowing of RM16.55b or 1.6x net gearing. Post debt reduction, the net gearing level is expected to be around 1.2x. In addition, this significant reduction in borrowings will also cause savings of around RM190m per year in interest costs.  Group orderbook is currently at RM16.7b, marking an inflection from FY18 low for the past four years. Out of these, approximately RM5.2b and RM3.8b are expected to be recognised in FY19 and FY20 respectively, while the remaining RM7.7b is to be recognised in FY21 onwards. The company’s bidbook, including prospects is at USD13.1b.  Should these corporate undertakings materialise in its entirety, we expect the company’s forward earnings to improve substantially – in particular from interest savings. Therefore, for FY19F in particular, we are expecting the group to return to the black. The chunk of the group earnings will stem from the upbeat offshore activity levels of the E&C segment and sustainably higher crude oil prices of the E&P segment.  We make no changes to our earnings estimates pending the take-up rate and further progress of these exercises.  Year-to-date, Sapura Energy’s share price has declined substantially. This is despite stable crude oil prices in the tight range of USD70pb. We are of the opinion that the current broad-market sell off presents trading opportunities for investors seeking exposure in oil and gas service providers with direct upstream exposure. Although we acknowledge that Sapura Energy’s profitability might still be weak due to its other underperforming segment, we believe that the share offers short term trading opportunities for investors. As such, we are maintaining our  call on Sapura Energy with an unchanged  per share. Source:   - 27 Aug 2018"

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Mon, 27 Aug 2018, 9:31 AM ",Sapura Energy Berhad - Recapitalisation Plan to Raise RM4b,,"Last Friday, SAPNRG announced a recapitalisation exercise, which includes; (i) proposed rights issue on the basis of 5 rights for every 3 shares, issue price of RM0.30, together with 1 free warrant for every 10 rights, exercisable at RM0.49 within 7 years, and (ii) proposed rights issue of Islamic redeemable convertible preference shares (RCPS-i) on the basis of 2 RCPS-i for every 5 shares, at an issue price of RM0.41, 5% dividend rate, and 1-to-1 conversion after 5 years. Targeted timeline for the listing of rights and RCPS-i is by end of the calendar year. All-in, the recapitalisation exercise is expected to raise a total of RM4b (RM3b from the rights issue, and RM1b from the RCPS-i), which will be primarily used for borrowings repayment. Post-exercise, we estimate SAPNRG’s netgearing to be reduced to c.0.8x, from 1.6x currently (group’s total borrowings stood at RM16.5b as at end-1QFY19). We have also adjusted our FY20E core earnings to RM195.6m (previously RM51.6m) to account for the savings in interest expenses. We gathered that the company has RM3.8b of debt due in Feb 2019, while it has also maxed out all its bank guarantee facilities for performance or bid bonds. As such, we feel that the success of the recapitalisation exercise may be vital for the company to avoid facing risks of borrowings default. All-in, we are negatively biased towards the exercise given: (i) the huge share-base dilution, which could see its share-base jump by 3.2x (or 3.1x assuming no warrants conversion) post-exercise, coupled with (ii) the hefty capital injection required by shareholders to undergo the entire exercise. As an illustration, based on our calculations, shareholders would have to fork out RM0.66 per existing share to subscribe to the entire exercise (RM0.50 per existing shares for the rights, and RM0.16 for the RCPS-i). Nonetheless, the de-leveraged balance sheet post-exercise would allow the company enhanced working capital capabilities to perform on its jobs bids, which jumped to USD7.4b for 2018 (vs USD2.5b for 2017) on top of additional prospective bids of RM10.2b, as well as execute its order-book of RM16.7b as at end-1QFY19 (improved from RM14.9b as at end-FY18). Moving forward, the company could also be seeking to raise additional capital through the spin-off listing of its E&P arm by end of the year. We guesstimated listing valuations to be around 1-1.5x PBV (E&P segment’s book value that stood at RM4.1b as at end-FY18). Given the heavy capital outlay required, which the market might not have the appetite to digest, we have decided to lower our valuations to 0.4x PBV at -1.5SD (from 0.5x at -1SD previously); thus, arriving at a lower cum/ex-TP of RM0.400/RM0.330 (from RM0.770 previously). We note that any further downward revision of its rights issue price could pose further pressure on its share price, thus possibly warranting further de-rating. Risks to our call include (i) stronger-than-expected margins, and (ii) greater-than-expected contracts replenishment. Source:   - 27 Aug 2018"

It will also issue additional RCPS-i at an issue price of RM0.41, representing 40% of its current share base totalling RM983m. The RCPS-i will be convertible based on a 1-to-1 ratio in 5 years, with a 5% annual dividend rate. Together the total cash raised amounts to RM4bn, with the deal expected to be completed by 4QCY18. As part of the deal, SAPE will also be issuing free warrants on the basis of 1- for-10 rights issue subscribed, with a 7-year expiry. The indicative exercise price of the warrant at RM0.49 implies a 32% premium over SAPE’s theoretical ex-price of RM0.37. The entire amount of the proposed RM4bn raise, excluding RM21m related expenses, will be utilised to pare down RM3.96bn debt, falling due on Feb- 2019. This represents 24% of SAPE’s total borrowings, which will result in an annual RM190m interest cost savings once fully repaid. Effectively, gross gearing level will be reduced from 1.74x (as of end FY18) to 0.86x, on the assumption that all rights issue, RCPS-i and warrants are fully converted. While we are positive on SAPE’s intention to pare down part of its huge debt; based on the maximum scenario, the share base will increased by 3x, from 6bn to 18.4bn shares. With warrants conversion, the enlarged share base will increased to 19.4bn. This will result in a huge EPS dilution to shareholders, which is not value accretive as a whole. A leaner balance sheet, post exercise will help SAPE to be more competitive in new contract biddings. However, we believe additional debt may be necessary in the near future to fund new projects. From our understanding, SAPE is required to provide a 10% upfront performance bond for projects secured. Effectively, for every US$1bn contract secured, SAPE may likely need to raise RM400m of new debt. On the bright side, SAPE will have 2 more years to improve their financials as the next bullet repayment will only fall due beyond 2021. The indicated ASX listing of the Energy division will likely help to pare down more of its current debt, although not much details have been shared. After imputing the debt repayment which will reduce the net debt position by ~RM4bn and factoring in the enlarged share base, we derive our new  (from RM0.65). We maintain our earnings forecasts pending finalisation of the deal but have provided a simulation below (Fig 3).

	SAPNRG 
	Facebook page link:  
	1. This company we shared previously that they have one and only way to reduce their debt is to do right issue. This is a must because of their debt is too high. Today news released on the afternoon. Open market on 2.30pm, it experience a free fall towards new low 0.37 and closing rebounded towards 0.415. 
	  
		2. Most of the investors or traders will never like a company to take money from them. In future might be good for SAPNRG. This company require at least two to three years to recover. Many expecting they can recover easily with many contracts awarded. However, they doesn't understand how a business works. 
		  
		3. Even if the oil price reach towards 100USD per barrel. All the oil and gas compant still require time to recover. Some of the oil and gas company might not even recover because they lack of contracts on hand. Previously UMWOG or now named as Velesto also did a right issue to reduce their heavy debt. 
		  
		4. Throughout the whole year, this company having ups and down nonstop. It dropped into penny stock category. As a result, many operators or syndicate love to use this company to operate because highly liquidity. I'm sure that many of the people outside there stuck in this company because they buy without knowing what they are doing. People say oil price sky rocket so they go follow the hottest oil and gas stock in the market. In the end facing huge loss if they are not enough discipline. 
		  
		5. A kind reminder to those who have this. For the time being its a proposal only. When things are confirm, you have two choice only. Subscribe the right issue and wait for at least one or two years. If not you need to cut loss. Basically stock market is a high risk game. It wipe off people who doesn't know what they are doing and treating stock market as casino. We always advice that do not involve in place that everyone talking about it. Previously like Hengyuan is a good example.

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Mon, 30 Jul 2018, 9:28 AM ",PublicInvest Research Headlines - 30 Jul 2018,Economy Markets Market Update," The US economy grew at its fastest pace in nearly four years in 2Q as consumers boosted spending and farmers rushed shipments of soybeans to China to beat retaliatory trade tariffs before they took effect in early July. President Donald Trump, who ahead of Friday's release of the GDP report had promoted the notion that 2Q growth would be robust, declared victory. GDP increased at a 4.1% annualised rate also as government spending picked up, the Commerce Department said in its snapshot of 2Q GDP. While that was the strongest performance since 3Q of 2014, it was not the best since the recession ended in mid- 2009. (Reuters)  America’s labor market looks red hot, but company earnings calls show little evidence of businesses getting burned. July jobs data, scheduled for release on Aug. 3, are expected to show an unemployment rate hovering around its lowest level since 2000. Yet many corporations describe labor tightness and wage pressures as manageable in their conference calls on earnings. Some are paying more but passing on costs to customers, while many are making up for wage hikes with efficiency improvements. Others report that they’re having no trouble at all with hiring. Only a handful say that things have gotten so tight that they’re struggling to boost their labor pool and missing out on business as a result. (Bloomberg)  Profit growth for China’s industrial firms eased in June from the previous month, as factory production slowed amid rising trade frictions with the US and Beijing’s ongoing efforts to cut pollution and debt. Profits could be further crimped in the second half of the year as trade woes deepen, adding more pressure on growth in the world’s second-largest economy. Industrial profits rose 20% to CNY658.29bn (USD96.7bn) in June, National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data showed, compared with a 21.1% rise in May. NBS said in a statement on the data that rising prices had cushioned firms’ profits even as industrial production slowed in June, but it did not provide separate reasons for the slower profit growth. (Reuters)  China used to rail against the outsize role of the USD. But in a major turnaround, the world’s second-biggest economy has started embracing the currency of its larger rival. Chinese companies and banks—and even the government—sold bonds denominated in dollars at a record pace last year, and underwriters expect that growth to continue for years. The roughly half-trillion-dollar market has two key attractions for China’s borrowers. For some, it’s an easier place to raise cash than at home—where regulators are cracking down on leverage. For others, dollars are simply easier to use to fund acquisitions and investments abroad. (Bloomberg)  The BOJ offered to buy an unlimited amount of bonds for a second time this week, seeking to tame a yield increase spurred by speculation it may adjust its ultra-loose monetary policy. Yields and the yen pared gains. The offer, made at 0.1% for the 5 year-10 year maturities, came after the benchmark yield reached that level for the first time in a year on Thursday. It’s down from the 0.11% level that the BOJ had offered in four previous operations for the zone. While the fixed-rate operation signals that the central bank continues to be guided by its target to keep the 10-year yield around 0%, traders would look for clarity when governor Haruhiko Kuroda announces the latest policy decision on July 31. (Bloomberg)  Vietnam’s inflation slowed for the first time in four months, the General Statistics Office said. Consumer prices rose 4.46% in July from a year earlier after climbing 4.67 percent in June. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists was 4.9%. Prices dropped 0.09% from the previous month. Vietnam also posted a trade deficit of USD300m in July, with exports at USD19.5bn and imports at USD19.8bn, according to data from the Hanoi-based statistics office. (Bloomberg)  The construction project for the electricity delivery network through the forest area around Janda Baik has received the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Environmental Management Plan (EMP) reports. The project belonging to Tenaga Nasional (TNB) and costing RM1.5bn received the EIA approval on Oct 12, 2017 followed by the EMP on Dec 28, 2017. The project, which is a national project with the government acting as the facilitator, involved the Lentang forest reserve area measuring 170 hectares, from Janda Baik to Lenggeng, Negeri Sembilan. (Bernama)  Axiata Group will record a non-cash financial loss of RM1.5bn to RM3bn following the approval by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) of India on the merger between India Cellular Ltd (Idea), Vodafone India Ltd (Vodafone India) and Vodafone Mobile Services Ltd. The reclassification of Idea from associate to simple investment upon completion of the scheme is attributed to the dilution of Axiata's shareholding from 16.33% to 8.17%. The estimated loss is expected to have a material impact on the financial quarter ended June 30 this year. (The Edge)  The Court of Appeal dismissed the application by JAKS Resources for an Erinford Injunction to restrain the payout of a RM50m bank guarantee to Star Media Group. The bank guarantee was in relation to an agreement between Star Media and JAKS's subsidiary Jaks Island Circle SB for the latter to develop a 15-storey tower within the Pacific Star development in Section 13, Petaling Jaya. JIC filed the fresh Erinford Injunction in the Court of Appeal to restrain two banks from releasing the guarantee, after the High Court dismissed an earlier application.

(The Edge)  Syarikat Takaful Malaysia Keluarga reported an 11.9% increase in its latest quarterly net profit to RM50.42m, from RM45.07m a year ago, attributed mainly to higher net wakalah fee income. Gross earned contributions for the 2QFY18 stood at RM510.50m, up 14% from RM447.405m in the same quarter last year. This resulted in an EPS of 6.12sen against 5.55sen previously. Revenue rose 11.8% to RM542.43m, from RM485.34m in the last year. Takaful Malaysia attributed the higher revenue to higher sales generated by its Family and General Takaful business. (The Edge)  Velesto Energy has bagged a contract worth US$25m (RM101.52m) to provide drilling rig services for Sarawak Shell or Sabah Shell Petroleum Company Ltd (SSB/SSPC). The contract awarded by SSB/SSPC to its unit Velesto Drilling SB has a tentative commencement date between Aug 1 and Sept 30, 2018. Velesto Drilling is a unit under Velesto Malaysian Ventures SB, which is in turn a wholly-owned subsidiary of Velesto Energy. The contract is for the provision of jack up drilling rig services for Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s subsidiaries, SSB/SSPC, based in Miri and Kota Kinabalu respectively. (The Edge)  Gabungan AQRS has filed two separate suits to several parties for the breach of contract for the provision of accommodation to Petronas Chemicals Fertiliser Sabah SB. The suits have been filed by two of its subsidiaries, namely Trusvest SB and Gabungan Strategik SB respectively, against Seri Wilayah Engineering SB and six others, and Imaprima SB and six others, respectively. Noting Trusvest alleged that the consortium of Seri Wilayah Engineering and REMT Utama SB had breached the terms and conditions of a sub contract. (The Edge) The FBM KLCI might open lower as Wall Street ended last week on a negative note as technology stocks took a decisive turn lower and participants looked beyond news of robust US economic growth in the second quarter of the year. The Nasdaq Composite index retreated further from Wednesday’s record closing high — and was on course to end lower for the week — with Twitter a notable faller after it reported a drop in active users. The slide for the stock came just a day after Facebook tumbled 19% after it warned of slowing growth. Intel also fell sharply on Friday but Amazon rose after its quarterly earnings beat forecasts. European stocks had a better day with the region-wide Stoxx 600 index closing at a six-week high. Carmakers gave back some of the previous day’s gains, which were largely driven by an agreement between the US and EU to begin discussions on easing trade tensions, seen by many as reducing the risks of tariffs on the sector. Meanwhile, the US economy grew at an annualised rate of 4.1% in the second quarter, up from 2.2% in the first three months of the year and the fastest pace in nearly four years. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 fell 0.7% to 2,818, but was still up 0.6% for the week. The Nasdaq Composite shed 1.5%, leaving it some 2.5% down from last week’s record peak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 76.01 points, or 0.3%, to 25,451.06. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 ended 0.4% higher as Frankfurt’s Xetra Dax added 0.4% and the FTSE 100 in London gained 0.5%. Back home, the FBM KLCI index gained 2.91 points or 0.2% to 1,769.14 points on Friday. Trading volume decreased to 2.34bn worth RM1.98bn. Market breadth was negative with 382 gainers as compared to 511 losers. The Topix index in Tokyo added 0.6% while the CSI 300 index of Shanghai and Shenzhen-listed stocks slipped 0.4%.

		THERE are a couple of things that we can take away from the debate arising from  ’s remuneration paid to its top executive Tan Sri Shahril Shamsuddin. 
		One is not to take investors/shareholders for granted, and secondly, the importance of communication. 
		Remuneration paid to directors is deliberated by a Remuneration Committee which makes a recommendation to the board, which then is eventually approved at the company’s AGM. 
		So, if a top executive is paid a hefty remuneration that seems “out of the ordinary”, it should be explained in the annual report, which is an important element in the genre of public discourse. 
				image: https://content.thestar.com.my/smg/settag/name=lotame/tags=all,Int_Property,Int_Tech_Telco 
		In Sapura Energy’s case, the Minority Shareholder Watch Group voiced their unhappiness over Shahril’s total pay package of RM71.92mil for the financial year 2018 (FY18) at the company’s AGM earlier this week. 
		A representative of MSWG said after the AGM that the issue of Shahril’s remuneration was brought up many times in previous AGMs, but the company only “noted the matter” without taking any action. 
		According to the company’s 2018 annual report, Shahril was paid a salary and related emoluments of RM7.24mil. He was also awarded with a RM55mil bonus, which was based on the prior year’s group performance and achievements, along with RM9.34mil in defined contribution plan and RM348,000 in various benefits-in-kind. 
		Past annual reports showed that Shahril’s total remuneration between FY14 and FY17 was above the RM80mil band, with the bulk of it comprising huge bonus payments. Shahril is Sapura Energy’s single largest shareholder with a 15.9% stake. 
		A day after the shareholders meeting, it came to light that Shahril’s remuneration was tied to a share covenant that he has with financial institutions when the company refinanced its huge RM14bil borrowings. 
		Shahril told a local financial daily that if he were to sell his shares to below 10%, the loan would default, and if he were to step down from being the CEO, the loan would also be in default. 
		However, the share covenant issue was not stated in the annual reports. 
		Why was it left out? 
		With growing shareholder activism, listed companies need to have sound shareholder communication. 
		This is especially the case when it involves directors’ remuneration. 
		Sapura Energy counts funds like the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), The Retirement Fund Inc, Amanah Saham Bumiputera and Lembaga Tabung Haji as shareholders. 
		These institutions manage money from the members of the public and are compelled to play a “watchdog role”. 
		The market often perceives these funds as not being robust enough in promoting good corporate governance and corporate accountability. The case of Sapura Energy dispels this. 
		 
		IN his previous term as Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad introduced the concept of Malaysia Inc. It was meant to be a bond between the public and private sectors, both working together to develop the country. 
		Malaysia Inc worked well as Malaysia managed transformed itself from an agrarian economy and saw the rapid industrialisation and the growth of manufacturing as the base of the economy. 
		It was during that time of Malaysia Inc where many of the privatisation projects were undertaken to rebuild national finances and kick start growth where businesses flourished, job in abundance were created and both the public and private sector flourished. 
		This time around, revisiting Malaysia Inc may seem like the right thing to do. The country’s finances need to be rebuilt, and there is a lot of scope for privatisation of government owned companies. 
		Many of them however will be smaller than the giant state owned enterprises that were headed to the stock market and help build corporate Malaysia. 
		The need to restart Malaysia Inc is also similar with the objectives when it first started. As the government seeks to shore up its finances, cut out the fat and eradicate corruption, its hands will be tied and preoccupied with rebuilding the civil service. 
		The role of creating growth, employment and wealth will then fall on the private sector, which has always been the priority of the government regardless of the times. 
		The private sector, however, needs to know the rules of the game has changed. 
		For long, there has been too much emphasis on who you know rather than what you can do. Hands had to be greased and that adds to the cost of doing business. 
		But now, with Malaysia Inc 2.0, the private sector would have fairer access to the market and choose what they want to do without being crowded out by the public sector and government-linked companies. 
		The government now has a golden chance to make Malaysia Inc 2.0 to be much better than the first iteration. And it should take that opportunity to make the private sector the engine of growth a more lasting one than before. 
		 
		PRESIDENT Donald Trump is ready to scale up the trade war by imposing tariffs on US$505bil worth of goods from China. 
		This has rattled stock markets across the world with German Chancellor Angela Merkel describing the situation as “very serious” and that it requires a quick solution. 
		China in return has so far devalued the yuan, which is the text book solution when a country faces trade wars. The yuan may depreciate now and appreciate a year later – depending on the relationship between the US and China. 
		Meanwhile, the manufacturers in China are not taking chances. They are looking at re-locating their factories to countries in the region. They feel that the trade war will be a long-term affair and impact their operations. 
		The trade war has also expedited the plans by some manufacturers to re-locate their operations due to the rising wages in China. 
		Heading the list of countries that manufacturers from China are re-locating are places where wages are generally lower such as Vietnam and Myanmar. It has been reported that some 30 manufacturers are already heading to Myanmar to look for suitable places to start factory operations. 
		It would be not be long before manufacturers from China start looking at countries such as Malaysia and Thailand where the rule of law is followed and manufacturers are well supported by good infrastructure. 
		The trade war has its positives although as a whole it is bad for global trade.

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Thu, 19 Jul 2018, 10:15 AM ",Shahril explains his high pay,,"
	KUALA LUMPUR: Part of the fat salary that Sapura Energy Bhd president and chief executive officer (CEO) Tan Sri Shahril Shamsuddin draws hinges on a share covenant that he has with financial institutions, when the oil and gas group refinanced its whopping RM14 billion in borrowings. 
	Shahril confirmed the existence of this covenant, and it being the reason for his high remuneration package when contacted by The Edge Financial Daily. 
	“Yes, we have explained this in the AGM (annual general meeting). It is true that part of the remuneration package is for the share covenant that has locked up my shares in Sapura Energy. 
	“This means that if I sell my shares (below 10%), the loan will default. If I step down [from being the CEO], the loan will be in default as well,” said Shahril, who was grilled in the group’s AGM yesterday over his high pay of RM71.92 million in the financial year ended Jan 31, 2018 (FY18), and RM84.24 million in FY17. 
	Shahril is the single largest shareholder of Sapura Energy holding a 15.9% stake. The share covenant was not stated in the annual reports. 
	He reiterated that he did not ask for the high compensation. “My salary is determined by the board. The board is independent … I did not ask for it (compensation). It is the board which decides on this. 
	“When someone offers me this, of course I will accept. I am just an officer of the company. And yet I am willing to do this. I could have sold my shares at RM4 but I didn’t; I didn’t even sell a single share … the opportunity cost is far more [than the compensation],” said Shahril. 
	Sapura Energy’s share price has not been spared from selling pressure amid the prolonged industry downturn that began in late 2014. Its share price peaked at RM4.84 at end-December 2013. The stock tumbled to a record low of 41 sen at mid-March. It closed at 60 sen yesterday. 
	Shahril pointed out that the group’s remuneration committee made the recommendation to the board, and the board will decide on the proposals. 
	Sapura Energy’s board remuneration committee consists of its chairman Datuk Hamzah Bakar, independent director Mohamed Rashdi Mohamed Ghazalli and Shahril. 
	On the share covenant, it started back in FY14, according to Shahril. “With the loan refinancing, we managed to get better rates with an average of about 5%, compared with others in the industry that are paying 6% to 7%,” he said. 
	The group’s annual reports indicated that Shahril’s salary was above the RM80 million band between FY14 and FY17. His remuneration package, however, shrank slightly to RM71.92 million in FY18 when the group dipped into the red with a net loss of RM2.5 billion, dragged down by a massive RM2.13 billion impairment provision. 
	“They (shareholders) said my remuneration is too high. As a shareholder, I respect that. But one thing that people don’t see is the effort that the management has put in place for future growth,” he said. 
	“The company should be measured relative to others that have gone bust locally and globally. Shareholders should also evaluate us in non-financial terms, for example the PSC (production sharing contract) that we won in Mexico, the new jobs that we have gotten in Brazil ... that [contributes] a lot more to future growth,” Shahril added.

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Mon, 9 Jul 2018, 9:32 AM ",PublicInvest Research Headlines - 9 Jul 2018,Economy Markets Market Update," There’s still more room to run for America’s labor market, just as a trade war threatens the outlook for the world’s largest economy. Job gains of 213,000 in June topped projections, Labor Department figures showed Friday. At the same time, more people entered the labor force to look for work, helping push the unemployment rate up for the first time in almost a year. Wages missed forecasts, with the relatively tepid pace remaining a puzzle for economists. Altogether, the data depicted a labor market that’s not as tight as previously thought, easing any pressure on Federal Reserve policy makers to step up the pace of interest-rate hikes and potentially heartening employers who have had difficulty finding skilled workers. (Bloomberg)  President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on every single Chinese import into America as the world’s two largest economies exchanged the first blows in a trade war that isn’t set to end anytime soon. Trump is already eyeing another USD16bn of Chinese goods, and he indicated to reporters Thursday on Air Force One that the final tariff total could exceed USD500bn, almost the same amount that the US imported in 2017. China’s Commerce Ministry accused the US of “bullying” and igniting “the largest trade war in economic history.” (Bloomberg)  IMF MD Christine Lagarde said on Saturday that a proposed joint euro zone budget could be designed with conditions so that it does not become a no-strings-attached transfer of rich countries’ cash to poorer members. The leaders of France and Germany agreed last month on a proposal for such a budget that would be used to smooth out economic difference between euro zone countries and stabilize their economies when facing shocks. “This centralized budget capacity does not need to become a payment facility,” Lagarde said. “It can very well have disciplinary conditions attached,” Lagarde said. (Reuters)  The euro area must not lose its nerve over trade tensions with the US, and Europe needs to stay united as President Donald Trump calls into question the world order, ECB Executive Board member Benoit Coeure said on Sunday. Tariffs are not the most important issue, Coeure said. “It’s absolutely necessary to resist the temptation of euro pessimism or a feeling of powerlessness of Europe versus China and the US,” Coeure said. “It’s true that the world order is profoundly called into question,” he said. However, Europe had “unique tools to respond” if it could overcome its divisions. (Bloomberg)  BOE policy makers are adjusting to an upheaval at the statistical office at the very point when they need as much clarity as possible to help decide whether to raise interest rates next month. The UK Office for National Statistics is this week shaking up the way it reports growth, publishing monthly updates and delaying its usual quarterly figures. The new process method comes after most policy makers said last month they were prepared to wait to see how the economy evolved before hiking rates, a move investors and economists now expect them to make in Aug. (Bloomberg)  Malaysia-based Sapura Energy is considering listing its operations on the Australian stock exchange in a float that could be worth as much as AUD2.7bn, The Australian reports in its Dataroom section, citing unidentified sources. Plan comes as Sapura Energy moves to pay down its USD4.5bn debt pile, largely to Maybank, and as the oil price rally attracts equity investors to the resources space. BoA Merrill Lynch is working for Sapura Energy and while it has made it known that it has an interest in listing its exploration and production assets on Bursa Malaysia, it is understood that the group is weighing the merits of listing in Australia instead. (Bloomberg)  Ta Ann Holdings has received its first ever sustainable forest management certification for its Malaysian operations, for its forest plantation in Sarawak. Ta Ann announced that its Kapit Forest Management Unit (FMU), managed by its wholly-owned subsidiary Tanjong Manis Holdings SB, has been awarded a three-year Certificate for Forest Management (Natural Forest) under the Malaysian Timber Certification Scheme (MTCS) on June 11, 2018. (The Edge)  MISC has secured a 16-year charter contract with an estimated contract value of USD441m (RM1.78bn), commencing latest by Sept 1 this year. MISC said it has signed a long-term charter contract with Hess Exploration and Production Malaysia BV (HESS) for the lease of a floating, storage and offloading facility (FSO) known as FSO Mekar Bergading on a bareboat basis. Bareboat Charter refers to the lease (charter) of an entire vessel under an agreement whereby the lessor only provides the vessel, and operation of the vessel is undertaken by the charterer. (The Edge)  Two years since the commencement of sale discussions for the A&W Malaysia SB chain of quick service restaurants, KUB Malaysia has now found a buyer who will take up the entire interest in A&W Malaysia for a total consideration of RM34m. KUB via its whollyowned subsidiary Restoran Kualiti SB had entered into a sale and purchase agreement with Inter Mark Resources SB for RM34m, which comprises RM30m for A&W Malaysia’s entire equity interest and RM4m for reimbursement of intercompany balances. (StarBiz)  HCM Engineering SB, a wholly-owned unit of Protasco, is instructed to pay its sub-contractor a total of RM2.96m for a payment claim requested in Feb. Protasco said it has received an adjudication decision for the claim, following a dispute with Kuasatek (M) SB over the mechanical and electrical (M&E) work packages under a project previously awarded to HCM Engineering. (The Edge)  Plastic packaging manufacturer Versatile Creative said that its recent discovery of unauthorised payments by the company to third parties and the subsequent investigation it is conducting on the matter, are not expected to impact its operations. Its statement filed on Bursa Malaysia was in response to a query from the regulator about its July 3 announcement on the unauthorised payments. (The Edge) The FBM KLCI might open higher today after Wall Street stocks rose and European bourses recovered last Friday, as the jobs report for June provided some welcome distraction for investors who have spent the week tracking the latest round of the international trade dispute. The US employment data also knocked the dollar and left yields on Treasuries little changed as investors judged that the dip in earnings growth means the Federal Reserve won’t need to raise rates more quickly. The data showed the creation of 213,000 jobs in June, more than the 195,000 forecast. Average earnings rose 2.7 percent year on year, narrowly short of the 2.8 percent economists predicted. The S&P 500 closed out the week on a solid footing, up 0.9%, with the Nasdaq ticking up 1.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4%. The mood was more unsettled in Europe but also brightened late in the trading day. The region-wide Stoxx 600 recovered form earlier losses to end 0.2% higher, Frankfurt’s Xetra Dax 30 finished 0.3% stronger and London’s FTSE 100 was up 0.2%. Back home, the FBM KLCI index lost 26.79 points or 1.58% to 1,663.86 points on Friday. Trading volume decreased to 2.02bn worth RM2.00bn. Market breadth was negative with 286 gainers as compared to 539 losers. Washington on Friday imposed tariffs on US$34bn of imports from China. However, on Friday the CSI 300 index of major stocks in Shenzhen and Shanghai gained 0.7%, having earlier touched its lowest point since January 2017. That was enough to keep its loss for the week at under 4%. Wider Asian indices also recovered on Friday, with Tokyo’s Topix adding 0.9% and Seoul’s Kospi 0.7%. Source:   - 9 Jul 2018"

The E&C segment posted a sequentially flat revenue, but to our surprise reported a RM36.5m profit vis-à-vis the RM84m losses in 4QFY18. This was attributable to the doubling in operating profit in Brazil, as a result of better utilisations. On top of that, SAPE recorded some residual winding cost of SapuraAcergy in the previous quarter which was absent in 1QFY19.

Energy revenue declined 27% qoq despite similar 1.1mmbbl lifting volume and US$70/bbl oil price, due to higher gas-to-oil mix, which garnered a lower ASP.

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Mon, 2 Jul 2018, 10:00 AM ",Sapura Energy - 1QFY19: Short-term Rig Setback But Long-Term Revenues Improving,,"vs our and consensus loss forecasts of RM119m/RM82m respectively, even though 2H is expected to be stronger. Sapura Energy (SAPE) recorded an all-time low quarterly revenue, a negative surprise due to a lower-thanexpected rig utilisation. There were only close to four rigs working, which is below the guidance of 5 out of 15 rigs working. The energy division realised a 1Q oil price of US$70/bbl at unchanged volumes of 1.1mmboe (1QFY18: US$52/bbl), and also average gas prices of >US$3.5/mcf. However, energy’s PBT declined despite the higher O&G prices due to the offsetting factors of higher depreciation and interest cost base. E&C activity was stable from the ramp up of new contracts secured, despite being a typically low season. Brazilian pipe-laying support vessels (PLSV) continued to be fully utilised, contributing to the JV line. Its net gearing remains at 1.6x, while cash balance declined significantly from RM1.7b to RM1.3b due to a lower EBITDA of RM0.2b and capex incurred for energy and drilling. The wider rig loss was a negative surprise to us. Although we were aware that SKD Esperenza’s contract was completed and in transition for its new contract, the idle time was about 2 months and was longer than expected. Hence in 1QFY19, the rig utilization was closer to 4/15 tender rigs. We believe 2QFY19 will likely see 5 rigs working on SKD Alliance contract commencement in Apr 18. 2HFY19 will see six rigs working, as the incoming commencements of SKD Esperenza and SKD Berani will be offset by the expiry of SKD T- 17 by Jun/Jul 18. We believe utilisation recovery to 6-7 working rigs could enable the rig division to achieve profit breakeven. We understand rig charter rates have stabilised, after a decline of 30-40% from three years ago. . The orderbook recognition for the remainder of FY19/FY20 is at RM5.2b/RM3.8b. This compares to the previous guidance of RM5.6b/RM3.1b. These included the new contract wins, and the Brazilian PLSV JV contracts at RM2.2b p.a. (which falls under the JV/associate line). On 27 June, SAPE signed a production sharing contract (PSC) with DEA Deutsche (the main operator) and Premier Oil for Block 30 within the Sureste Basin in the Gulf of Mexico. This was the block that the group secured recently, marking its energy penetration into Mexico. The resources need to be appraised. Along with exploration potential in New Zealand and further new gas field discovery in Sarawak, there is a potential addition on top of its net 2P reserves of 253mmboe once the final investment and gas sales agreement for the additional discoveries are developed. The potential listing of the E&P division is still being considered There is now a new guidance that SAPE is also looking at further capital raising exercise to strengthen its balance sheet, though no estimate and timeline is given. It could be a mixture of equities and other forms of capital-raising such as perpetual securities, infrastructure funds and convertible bonds. Although it is difficult to gauge if investors will perceive the capital raising needs positively, we view that the timing of this new information is a strong signal that SAPE is close to securing more mega contracts that will require capital support. Recap that the group guided to boost orderbook to RM18- 20b within the year, and is also guiding for a flattish EBITDA growth from FY18 base of RM1.4b. We analyse that the remainder FY19 orderbook guidance translates into revenue of RM4.2b (assuming energy revenue at ~RM0.6b) for 2Q to 4QFY19, which implies that it is already close to our FY19 revenue assumption. Also, to meet the RM18b orderbook target, SAPE needs to secure another RM4b in contracts. This is necessary to boost FY20 revenue which has ~RM4b gap vs our FY20 revenue assumption. to RM185m,but retain FY20-21 profit forecasts. We have assumed a wider FY19 loss after lowering our rig utilisation assumption from 33% to 30%. However, we note that the group’s current FY19 orderbook guidance closely matches our revenue assumption. With this, we believe 2HFY19 performance will be stronger (possibly returning to profit breakeven) on the back of higher revenue/EBITDA from E&C and drilling (and higher rig utilisation). Further decline in orderbook and lesser orderbook wins. Our SOTP-based target price implies 39x FY20F PE and continues to assume a discount on rigs which are still loss-making. Our SOTP assumes a DCF valuation for the energy assets, assuming a long-term blended O&G price assumption of US$55/bbl and the group’s latest production profile (which has an upside bias once the new resources are appraised and added). This is offset by the debt attributed to energy (we assume 20% of the group’s borrowings, or US$0.7b). SAPE’s outstanding international track record and contract wins are beginning to translate into a better outlook for activities and asset utilisation. Hence, the long-term risk-reward is gradually adjusting in E&C and energy. The stock also fits into our sector theme to invest in companies that are internationally competitive and do not have high local contract dependency. We still see a sustainable earnings recovery, as the rigs prospect is beginning to improve (removal of major downside earnings risk) and the momentum of future contract wins will be positive to long-term earnings.

The number was weaker YoY by >100%, in line with lower revenue of 40.4% YoY to RM1.05bn in the quarter. E&C and E&P segments reported a profit while drilling business was still the main culprit, continuing to report pre-tax losses. Operational numbers remained positive nonetheless, with EBITDA of RM228m in 1QFY19 despite a slight decrease from the previous quarter’s RM272m. We make adjustments to our FY19-20 net earnings forecast by 122% on average, to reflect the weak 1QFY19 numbers while anticipating recoveries to take longer-than expected. Our forecast is now adjusted to a loss of RM242.6m for FY19.

This is premised on revenue level of RM1.1b. The losses mainly stem from the Drilling segment. However, EBITDA recorded healthy levels of RM228m.  Segment revenue remained flat q-o-q at RM665.6m but segment profit declined to RM36.5m. The lacklustre earnings are a result of low revenue and earnings recognition from the projects which are currently at hand. 1QFY19 segment operating margin is at 5.55% while segment EBITDA margin is at 8%.  1QFY19 segment revenue remained weak at RM183.4m while registering an operating loss of –RM68.7m. This is largely due to low utilisation rate of approximately 33% (this was guided earlier is previous reports). Despite this, the segment however recorded healthy EBITDA margin of 57%.  Segment revenue performed relatively well at RM209.8m while maintaining segment profitability as 1.1mmboe was lifted in 1QFY19 compared with 0.8mmboe in 1QFY19. The average crude lifting price was at USD70pb while EBITDA breakeven cost is at USD30-35pb.  Group orderbook is currently at RM16.7b, marking an inflection from FY18 low for the past four years. Out of these, approximately RM5.2b and RM3.8b are expected to be recognised in FY19 and FY20 respectively, while the remaining RM7.7b is to be recognised in FY21 onwards.

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Mon, 2 Jul 2018, 9:23 AM ",Sapura Energy Berhad - 1Q19 Within Expectations,,"SAPNRG’s 1Q19 core loss of RM136m was expected and deemed within our full-year loss estimate of RM204m as we foresee the quantum of losses to gradually narrow in subsequent quarters as (i) secured E&C contracts enter into more advance billings stages, coupled with (ii) higher utilisation of drillings rigs. That said, results were below consensus loss estimate of RM82m which we believe was due to consensus’ overly bullish forecasts in the E&C and drilling segments. No dividends declared as expected. Sequentially, SAPNRG’s core loss widened 3x QoQ to RM136m (from RM34m) mainly due to lower revenue from its drilling (-20%) and energy (-27%) segments. While total number of operational rigs was similar QoQ at 5 rigs; one of the rigs (Sapura Esperanza) was only utilised for 1 month in 1Q19. Furthermore, despite its energy segment producing similar volumes (at 1.1m bboe), the oil:gas split was lower by which 1mmboe of oil is worth more than 1mmboe of gas – leading to weaker contributions. That said, we note that 1Q19 core loss was partially cushioned by better JV & associates (+90%) contributions from its Brazil operations. YoY, 1Q19 sank into the red from a core profit position of RM5m in 1Q18 attributed to weaker revenue contributions (-41%) from all three segments (E&C, Drilling and Energy). Drilling segment was dragged by lower utilization of rigs (5 vs. 7) while the lower billings at E&C segment (-45%) were due to lower outstanding order-book recognisable at the beginning of the quarter (RM14.9b at the start of 1Q19 vs. RM16.7b at the start of 1Q18) coupled with higher mix of contracts still at infancy stage. Consequent to the poorer revenues, all segments’ PBTs were also weaker. YTD, SAPNRG has secured RM4.5b in contract awards (within our RM5.5b replenishment) bringing the current outstanding order-book to RM16.7b. We are optimistic on SAPNRG’s ability to achieve our replenishment target backed by tenders worth USD13b and expect E&C contributions to increase as contract works advances. As for its loss-making drilling division, we are anticipating a gradual recovery with rig utilisations to be higher through the recent two awards (secured in 2Q18) for Sapura Esperenza and Sapura Berani. Meanwhile, we are positive with SAPNRG’s entry into Mexico’s Block 30 with the recent PSC signing and farm-in agreements into five offshore exploration permits in New Zealand, which would provide new growth opportunities for the business in the long term. Post results, we make no changes to our FY19-20E earnings forecast with expectations of SAPNRG returning to the black in FY20 backed by: (i) RM6.0b order-book replenishment, and (ii) 50% utilisation for the drilling segment. All in, we reiterate our OUTPERFORM call with   RM0.770 pegged to PBV of 0.5x. Our call is premised on better contract flows led by E&C backed by the stronger crude prices and potential listing and monetization of its E&P assets. Downside risks to our call include: (i) weaker-thanexpected margins, and (ii) lower-than-expected contract replenishment. Source:   - 2 Jul 2018"

	 （1）所谓资本支出，或又称为收益支出，是指企业为取得长期资产而发出的支出。或为了取得为一个以上会计期间提供效益财产或劳务所发生的支出。资本支出通常包括固定资产增置及改造支出，并是为了获得更大的未来效益。 
	（2）油气上游股如沙布拉能源（SAPNRG,5218,主板贸服组）日前宣布亏很多钱，根据了解，其中主因是整体行业业者包括沙布拉能源，它们为旗下资产提供减值拨备所致，简单地说，就是当时随着油气价格大跌，油气上游市场的工程合约大减，甚至手上一些合约价值也需要重新检讨减价所致。随着目前国际油气价格回扬，使其业务前景获得改善或看好。 
	为什么投资者还是看好它的前景，这里引述外资证券公司-麦格理证券研究甫于6月7日对沙布拉能源的最新报告，可作为参考。 
	 
	该行认为，随着看好沙布拉能源在油气勘探及生产（E&P）及工程及建筑（E&C）业务的长期价值，使该行将其评级，从“落后大市”上调至“超越大市”评级，目标价（通常是未来12个月）则下调至1令吉（之前为1令吉35仙）。 
	目前是沙布拉能源的转捩点，预料在2019财政年的净亏损将缩减。该行看好其油气勘探及生产及工程及建筑业务的长期价值，特别是涉足的SK408气田生产的发展及行业的岸外资本开销出现反弹等支撑。 
	该行认为，短期内，若是该公司将旗下的油气勘探及生产业务分拆自行上市，将是重大利好，因有助为SK408气田活动融资减少公司负债。不过，该行提醒，该公司最坏情况的估值可低至24仙，最乐观估值水平则是1令吉93仙，差距落差很大，该行有所解释。 
	 
	首先，以好方面看，随着原油价格强力回弹，岸外领域的资本开销浮现强力复苏，支持该行认为沙布拉能源在2019财政年有望取得55亿令吉的新工程订单合约（今年至今为止已有27亿令吉）。截至2021财政年时，该公司旗下油气勘探及生产业务的产量将增加至3倍及把营业额也增加至3倍。若是在未来12个月里，它的油气勘探及生产业务成功自行上市，有关目标将有望提早实现。 
	第二种情况，就是不好方面看，今年3月，该公司旗下的钻油业务进行20亿令吉的减值，着实使市场感到震惊。为了反映此业务的低迷前景，而将它的预测财务数据大幅度降低，即将其企业价值（EV）腰斩至50亿令吉。此业务的资产使用率及出租率料将持续偏低，不过，预料额外下行空间也有限。 
	第三种情况，就是最坏情况，该公司150亿令吉的债务，其中大部份是在油气业最高峰周期时收购资产，而这些资产被减记，不过，债务却依然存在，从而吸收了2018财政年的8亿5800万令吉的盈利，或达营运盈利的2.2倍。该公司重组其债务，即把大部份的债务还款押后，所以，短期资金料没有问题。不过，长期则是需要重组它的资产负债表，特别是潜在自行上市活动。该公司2018财政年的净负债为1.6倍。 
	投资者有必要注意该公司潜在的风险，包括旗下公司业务延迟/或终止生产量、新工程订单不达标、减记商誉（总共达到79亿令吉水平）、以及未能减轻资产负债表内的债务。 
	主要利好催化因素则是旗下的油气勘探及生产业务自行分拆上市，这将可释放价值、有助减轻它的债务及利息成本、以及缓和它在2020财政年为发展SK408气田活动，所肩负的6亿令吉资本开销负担。这些好坏重点都必须加以关注，以及作为参考。 
	（3）油气是否复苏迹象，可关注国际油气价格、市场供需及库存量、国际主要产油国或商业资本开销的增减、如国家石油的资本投资/开销如上游勘探及采油领域的开销或颁发的工程订单合约等，可以作为参考。

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Fri, 22 Jun 2018, 8:50 AM ",Sapura Energy Berhad - RM1.8b Haul,," Yesterday, SARNRG announced that they have secured nine new contracts worth a combined value of RM1.8b. These contracts from Malaysia, Australia, Mexico and India comprise works from its E&C and drilling segment with contracts periods varying from three months to two years (refer overleaf for further breakdown of contracts). Overall, we are positive on the contracts which demonstrate SAPNRG’s ability to win contracts continuously amidst the competitive environment. As expected, SAPNRG had secured two EPC contracts to build three wellhead platforms and one integrated module for block SK408 in which they have a 40% working interest in the Production Sharing Contract (PSC). The other E&C contracts from India, Mexico and Australia comprise works on: (i) wells and pipeline replacement, (ii) construction and modification of Berths, (iii) EPCIC for 20km of pipelines, and (iv) lightwell intervention services. All in, we think these E&C projects could fetch EBITDA margins of c.15-20% which is in line with historical FY18 margin of 16%.  In addition to the E&C contracts, SAPRNG has secured two drillings contracts involving their (i) ‘Sapura Berani’, and (ii) ‘Sapura Esperanza’ drilling rigs. Sapura Berani will be utilized by Petronas Carigali S/B for drilling of 3 firm wells and an option to extend for additional 2+3+2 wells in Malaysian waters. The second drilling contract is an extension of contract by Shell for ‘Sapura Esperanza’ which would be used to drill three firm wells with option for another three wells in Sarawak and Terengganu. Note that we have imputed utilization rates of 40-50% in FY19-20E for SAPRNG’s drilling segment. With the new contracts totalling RM1.8b (outstanding order-book of c.RM17b), total contracts secured YTD is at RM4.5b, which is still within our FY19E assumption of RM5.5b (accounting for 82%). Therefore, we make no changes to our FY19-20E earnings forecasts.  Following the awards, we reiterate our  call on the stock with unchanged   pegged to PBV of 0.5x. Our call is premised on better contract flows backed by the stronger crude prices and potential monetisation of E&P assets. Downside risks to our call include: (i) weaker-than-expected margins, (ii) lower-than-expected contract replenishment, and (iii) contract termination. Source:   - 22 Jun 2018"

5218, SAPURA ENERGY BHD ," Tue, 12 Jun 2018, 9:38 AM ",PublicInvest Research Headlines - 12 Jun 2018,Economy Markets Market Update," IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said the risks to the global economy are rising as major industrial nations sharpen threats of a trade war. “The clouds on the horizon that we have signaled about six months ago are getting darker by the day -- and, I was going to say, by the weekend,” Lagarde said. Her remarks follow a chaotic two-day meeting of the Group of Seven in which President Donald Trump shocked fellow leaders with his disregard for US allies. After leaving the summit early, Trump tweeted he was pulling US support from a joint statement and he accused the host, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, of being weak and dishonest. Other G-7 countries lobbied unsuccessfully at the summit for the US to reverse new tariffs on imported steel and aluminum imports. Trump turned the tables by challenging world leaders to eliminate all trade barriers, tariffs and subsidies and he threatened to stop trading with them entirely. Lagarde’s concerns were echoed by World Trade Organization Director General Roberto Azevedo, who said growing trade frictions could cause serious damage to the world economy. (Bloomberg)  American consumer prices accelerated in May and costs paid to producers picked up, signs of a steady pickup of inflation that’s consistent with the Federal Reserve’s gradual approach to raising interest rates, government figures are projected to show this week. While recent announcements of price increases at Starbucks Corp. and Jack in the Box Inc. have garnered some attention, inflation pressures have been concentrated in services rather than goods, including food from restaurants. The exception more recently is fuel costs, with prices at the gas pump reaching a more than three-year high in May. But prices of core goods, which exclude food and energy, have been restrained for years. (Bloomberg)  French banks will need more capital to support lending in a downturn. The so-called countercyclical capital buffer requirement was activated for the first time and raised to 0.25% for French exposures, the High Council for Financial Stability said on Monday. The regulator pointed to swelling private-sector debt at 130% of economic output among its reasons for stepping in to bolster banks’ capital cushions. Banks already have enough capital to meet the demand, according to a person familiar with the matter. (Bloomberg)  UK manufacturing output fell the most in 5 ½ years in April and construction posted a smaller-than-expected gain, casting fresh doubt over the health of the economy. The pound fell. Factory production shrank 1.4%, the most since 2012, the Office for National Statistics said on Monday. Economists had expected an increase. Building output rose 0.5%, well short of the strong rebound expected after a snow-blighted March. There was also disappointing news on trade, as the deficit unexpectedly widened to a five-month high amid a sharp drop in exports to countries outside the EU. The figures may cause the Bank of England to question its assumption that the pronounced economic slowdown in the 1Q will prove temporary. (Bloomberg)  Japan’s core machinery orders in April jumped the most since the start of 2016, reversing the prior month’s decline and raising some hopes for durable growth in capital expenditure seen as crucial for a recovery in the economy after a contraction in the 1Q. Core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital expenditure in the coming six to nine months, rose 10.1% and handily beat a 2.8% gain forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. They fell 3.9% in March. (Reuters)  Sapura Energy said it has discovered its ninth gas exploration well in offshore Bintulu, Sarawak following the completion of its drilling campaign within Block SK408 in 2017. The group said the ninth well was discovered by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sapura Exploration and Production (Sarawak) Inc, and its two partners, Sarawak Shell and Petronas Carigali SB. Codenamed Pepulut-1, Sapura Energy said the ninth well encountered high quality reservoir within the Block SK408 production sharing contract. The well's discovery comes after the group's recent announcement of its development plans for Gorek, Larak and Bakong fields as phase one in the Block SK408.

We remain optimistic of the Group's prospects, short-term weaknesses notwithstanding, and retain our Trading Buy call with an unchanged sum-of-parts derived TP of RM1.11.

Metronic Engineering had commenced the adjudication proceeding under Construction Industry Payment and Adjudication Act 2012 (CIPAA) against Ahmad Zaki. (The Edge)  Ahmad Zaki Resources has been ordered by an adjudicator to pay Metronic Global’s wholly owned subsidiary Metronic Engineering SB (MESB) a sum of SAR4.75m (RM5.05m) within 30 days in relation to a nonpayment dispute.

(StarBiz) The FBM KLCI might open with a positive bias today after global equities started the week on a moderately positive note as participants appeared to largely shrug aside the weekend’s acrimonious G7 meeting and looked instead to a heavy schedule of risk events taking place this week. The S&P 500 pared an early rise but still reached its highest closing level in three months, while prices for highly rated government bonds edged lower. The “risk on” mood was helped by reassuring comments from Italy’s new finance minister, which helped shares in Milan sharply outperform their European peers and push the yield on the country’s two-year sovereign debt down by as much as 64 basis points. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 rose 0.1% to 2,782, its highest finish since March 12, having earlier reached 2,790.

The group said that they will focus on realizing the full value of their highly prospective gas fields in SK408 and on further strengthening their exploration & production (E&P) portfolio. SAPE’s share price closed unchanged at RM0.635 yesterday, up 8.5% week-on-week. Yesterday, SAPE reported the discovery of its ninth gas exploration well in offshore Bintulu, Sarawak following the completion of its 2017 drilling campaign within the SK408 production sharing contract. SAPE’s wholly-owned subsidiary encountered high quality reservoir at the Pepulut-1 exploration well in SK408, where it was developing gas fields with partners Sarawak Shell and Petronas Carigali. The well’s discovery came after the group’s recent announcement of its development plans for the Gorek, Larak and Bakong fields as phase one of the Block SK408 contract. In the statement yesterday, SAPE’s president and group CEO Tan Sri Shahril Shamsuddin attributes the successful gas discovery to the strength and capabilities of their exploration, subsurface and drilling team. He added that the recent discovery is in line with their strategy to unlock the value of their gas fields and enhance long term earnings visibility of their E&P business. In the meantime, the group will focus on realizing the full potential of their highly prospective gas fields in SK408 and on further strengthening their E&P portfolio (The Edge Markets, 11 Jun). For the past 18 months, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies have curbed production in hopes of stabilizing the market and supporting prices. The group is set to meet again on 22-23 June in Vienna to decide how to move forward with this policy, against the backdrop of tumbling Venezuelan output and looming sanctions against Iran, the third largest OPEC producer. Iraq’s oil minister Jabar al-Luaibi said in a press release yesterday that prices still require support and stability, and producers “should not over-exaggerate” the markets’ need for more supplies. Jabar’s statement added some uncertainty to the potential supply hikes by OPEC (Reuters, 11 Jun). Source: Macquarie Research - 12 Jun 2018"

MQ Research upgrades   to   (from Underperform) with a new sum-of-parts (SOP) based  (from RM1.35), MQ Research’s top pick for the sector.   is expected to post a smaller net loss in FY19E, however, MQ Research’s valuation reflects the long-term value in the E&P and E&C segment, underpinned by a production ramp-up in the SK408 gas field development and rebounding offshore capex, respectively. An E&P spin-off could be a major catalyst in the near term, funding SK408 capex and reducing group debt. Bull and bear case scenario valuations are RM0.24 and RM1.93, respectively.  MQ Research believes the E&P and the E&C segments are headed for an inflection point. Offshore capex is showing strong signs of recovery on stronger oil prices, supporting MQ Research’s base case RM5.5bn orderbook wins for FY19E (RM2.7bn won ytd).   plans to triple E&P production to ~12mmboe/yr by FY21, nearly tripling revenues. More importantly, the payoff could be brought forward if   manages a spin-off of the E&P assets in the next 12 months. The RM2bn impairment to the Drilling division gave the market a shock in March. MQ Research has significantly lowered their numbers to reflect the subdued outlook for this division, halving segment enterprise value (EV) to RM5bn. Utilisation and charter rates are expected to remain subdued but with minimal additional downside.  The bulk of  ’s RM15bn debt was used to fund acquisition of assets at the peak of the oil and gas (O&G) cycle. While the assets have been (somewhat) impaired, the debt remains – sponging up RM858m of profit in FY18; 2.2X earnings before interest and tax (EBIT). The group has restructured its debt to push back the bulk of repayments, so short-term liquidity is not a problem. The long-term need to restructure the balance sheet is a strong driver for potential spin-off; FY18 net gearing was 1.6x. Given weak sentiment, negative newsflow may have an outsized impact on the share price. In the short term, MQ Research expects more positive newsflow on contract wins for E&C as well as potential new discoveries for the E&P segment to improve sentiment.

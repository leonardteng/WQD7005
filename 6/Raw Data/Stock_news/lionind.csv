4235, LION INDUSTRIES CORP BHD ," Tue, 12 Mar 2019, 10:38 AM ",中越产品征反倾销税‧钢铁股闻风起舞,,"
		（吉隆坡11日讯）政府决定对中国和越南钢铁产品征收反倾销税，在利好消息带动下，钢铁股纷纷闻声走高，其中以销售镀锌钢铁产品的CSC钢铁（CSCSTEL,5094,主板工业产品服务组）涨势最佳，盘中一度急涨7.48%。 
		 
		政府对中越镀锌钢铁产品将征收最高16.13%税务，利好消息成功抬拉钢铁股上涨0.5仙至2仙，特别是CSC钢铁涨势傲视同侪，最高一度上涨6仙至1令吉15仙，最终以1令吉零8仙作收，全天起1仙，成交量达90万8300股。 
		其他钢铁股表现不俗，金狮工业（LIONIND,4235,主板工业产品服务组）和马来西亚钢厂（MASTEEL,5098,主板工业产品服务组）也引来投资者追逐。 
		金狮工业上升0.5仙至56.5仙，成交量高挂1715万4100股，马来西亚钢厂（MASTEEL,5098,主板工业产品服务组）走高2仙至51.5仙，共有1479万零300股易手。 
		至于协德（HIAPTEK,5072,主板工业产品服务组），也起0.5仙至29.5仙，成交量报504万1600股。 
		相较之下，安裕资源（ANNJOO,6556,主板工业产品服务组）独憔悴，闭市收低2仙，挂1令吉58仙，成交量提高到184万6400股。 
		 
		分析员认为，虽然反倾销税是钢铁业的“及时雨”，有助于减轻行业压力，但一些股项早已走高，反映了这项利好，因此钢铁股今日表现不算太过标青。 
		马银行研究表示，根据最新政策，凡从中国及越南进口相关钢铁产品，将被征税至2024年3月7日，为期5年。马银行相信，在该税务下，大马相关产品销售公司料可受惠，因进口钢铁产品平均售价比国内来得低。 
		截至2017年为止，大马51.7%的镀锌钢铁消耗量是来自进口，而2015年进口比率只有39.7%，而CSC钢铁2017的市占率只有26%，对比2015年，市占率为36%。 
		马银行根据内部渠道得知，提高税务虽是利好消息，但该税务的帮助仍有限，因价格仍低于现有售价，因此帮助并不大。因此，该行相信CSC钢铁可受惠，但帮助程度不大。 
		马银行假设，若CSC相关产品可增加1%销售，那么2019至2021年盈利预测可增加9.7至10.6%。该股保持“卖出”评级，目标价为83仙。 
		达证券亦认同马银行观点，认为CSC钢铁仍需面对较高的原料成本及廉价的冷轧铁的竞争，因此与马银行同样维持CSC钢铁的“卖出”评级不变，目标价则是68仙。

4235, LION INDUSTRIES CORP BHD ," Tue, 8 Jan 2019, 9:46 AM ",PublicInvest Research Headlines - 8 Jan 2019,Economy Markets Market Update," US services sector activity slowed to a five-month low in Dec, but remained above a level consistent with solid economic growth in the 4Q. The Institute for Supply Management said its non-manufacturing activity index fell to 57.6 last month, the lowest reading since July, from 60.7 in Nov. Still the index stayed well above the 50 mark, suggesting expansion of the vast services sector. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 59.0. (Reuters)  The Federal Reserve may only need to raise interest rates once in 2019, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said, focusing on business executives’ nervousness about the economy and a global slowdown as factors that may hold the US central bank back. “I am at one move for 2019,” Bostic said. Though US economic growth was faster than expected in 2018 and prompted the Fed to raise rates four times, Bostic said his business contacts appear less confident about the coming months, while “clouds” have developed overseas. (Reuters)  US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross predicted on Monday that Beijing and Washington could reach a trade deal that “we can live with” as dozens of officials from the world’s two largest economies resumed talks in a bid to end their trade dispute. Ross told CNBC the immediate trade issues would be easiest to tackle while enforcement issues and structural reforms, such as intellectual property rights and market access, would be more challenging to resolve. (CNBC)  British and European officials are discussing the possibility of extending Article 50 amid fears a Brexit deal will not be approved by March 29, The Daily Telegraph reported, citing unidentified sources. The Telegraph cited three unidentified EU sources as saying British officials had been ""putting out feelers"" and ""testing the waters"" on an extension of Article 50, Britain's formal notice to withdraw from the EU. The EU is considering ways to help Prime Minister Theresa May convince the British parliament to back the Brexit treaty she agreed with EU leaders last month but ruled out on Monday any change to the deal. (StarBiz)  Assets worth nearly GBP800bn (USD1trn) are being moved from Britain to new financial hubs in the European Union ahead of Brexit, consultancy EY said. Britain, which is due to leave the bloc in March, has yet to approve a deal to avoid an abrupt severing of ties with the EU. Although the British parliament is due to vote on a proposed settlement next week, it is unclear if it will be approved. ""The closer we get to March 29 without a deal, the more assets will be transferred and headcount hired locally or relocated,"" Omar Ali, UK financial services leader at EY, said. (Reuters)  Growth in Japan’s services sector slowed at the end of 2018 as poor weather and weaker demand growth provided a drag, according to an industry gauge. The Nikkei-Markit services purchasing managers’ index dipped to a three-month low of 51 in Dec, down from 52.3 in Nov and bringing the reading closer to the 50- point level separating expansion from contraction. Companies surveyed reported a modest improvement in demand and a weaker increase in new export orders. Slowing growth in the services sector came in contrast to the improvement seen in the manufacturing sector in Dec. (Financial Times)  Greater concerns over the weak economic landscape has dragged down optimism among corporate and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to the lowest level since the inception of the RAM Business Confidence Index (RAM BCI) survey two years ago. The latest survey conducted by RAM Holdings and RAM Credit Information SB among 3,500 firms in the country showed that Corporate and SME Indices for the 1Q - 2Q 2019 have dropped to 55.1 and 51.0 from 55.7 and 53.5 in 4Q 2018 -–1Q 2019, respectively. It said although the index value of above 50.0 still denotes positive sentiment, the current downtrend has suggested that businesses have a less upbeat outlook for 2019. (Bernama)  Bank Negara’s international reserves remained unchanged at USD101.4bn as at Dec 31, 2018 compared with two weeks earlier. According to a statement by the central bank, the reserves were sufficient to finance 7.4 months of retained imports and were one time the short-term external debt. The main components of the international reserves were foreign currency reserves (USD95.7bn), International Monetary Fund reserves position (USD900m), Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) (USD1.1bn), gold (USD1.6bn) and other reserve assets (USD2.1bn). The ringgit had strengthened slightly against the US dollar during the two-week period to 4.1426 on Dec 31 from 4.1822 on Dec 14. (StarBiz)  KKB Engineering’s subsidiary OceanMight SB has qualified as one of Petroliam Nasional’s (Petronas) contractors for the provision of engineering, procurement and construction of fixed offshore structure works. (StarBiz) Comments: KKB Engineering Bhd's 60.81%-owned unit OceanMight Sdn Bhd has signed a letter of award (LoA) by Petroliam Nasional Bhd, which will qualify it to bid for contract work involving the provision of engineering, procurement and construction of fixed offshore structure works. We understand that a formal contract shall be executed within three months from acceptance of the said LoA while the contract is said to be effective from Dec 12, 2018 and will continue for a period of six years, unless terminated earlier. No contract value was disclosed. In FY18, the group secured c.RM300m worth of oil and gas-related jobs and was reported to have tender book worth RM350m for a combination of oil and gas, steel pipe supplies and other projects in FY4Q08. It has since announced the award of c.RM47m worth of steel pipes supplies contract back in December 2018. Pending more clarifications, our earnings estimates are kept unchanged for now. All told, we maintain our Neutral call and target price (TP) pegged at c.0.9x to book value, suggesting fair value of RM0.95.  JAKS Resources has failed again in its bid to get the court's permission to appeal against the release of a RM50m bank guarantee to Star Media Group. JAKS, in a separate filing, said its unit is seeking legal advice on the next course of action. (The Edge)  Lion Industries Corp is divesting its entire 50% stake in Singaporebased Angkasa Amsteel Pte Ltd to a South Korean steel manufacturer for SGD26.6m (RM80.9m) to raise funds for its flat steel business venture. The proceeds of the disposal will be used for its expansion into the flat steel business, which will require approximately RM636m. (The Edge)  Gagasan Nadi Cergas announced that it has secured an RM109.99m contract to build two blocks of apartments in Putrajaya. The contract is for a duration of 34 months and is expected to be completed by Nov 2021. (The Edge)  Microlink Solutions has accepted a letter of award from Payments Network Malaysia SB (PayNet) for the supply and implementation of a Real-Time Electronic Transfer of Funds and Securities System (Rentas) platform replacement worth RM27.4m. (The Edge)  Destini’s unit has received a further three-year extension from the Home Affairs Ministry to maintain, repair and overhaul safety and survival equipment for the Royal Malaysian Police's Pasukan Gerakan Udara. Its unit Destini Prima SB received the letter of extension on Jan 4, with the contract's ceiling value kept at RM10m, Destini said. The extension will expire on Nov 29, 2021. (The Edge) The FBM KLCI might open higher today as optimism about the outcome of trade talks between Washington and Beijing helped US stocks start the week on the front foot, with underlying support still coming from Friday’s soothing policy comments from Jay Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve. Mr Powell’s remarks that the US central bank would be “patient” with regard to further interest rate rises helped calm worries about a possible Fed policy error, and helped put the dollar under pressure, even as Treasury yields moved higher. Oil prices extended their recent run of gains to a sixth session, as the markets focused on Opec production cuts due to come into force this month. The mood was also helped by hopes that an easing of US-China trade tensions could support global growth. Meanwhile, Wall Street appeared unfazed by the latest sign that US economic growth was cooling. The Institute for Supply Management’s headline non-manufacturing index fell to a five month low in December. At the closing bell, the S&P 500 ended 0.7% higher at 2,549, having touched 2,566, for a two-day gain of 4.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4% while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.2%. Across the Atlantic, Frankfurt’s Xetra Dax ended 0.2% softer, having earlier been down as much as 0.8%. The FTSE 100 in London slipped 0.4% while the region wide Stoxx 600 shed 0.2%. Back home, the FBM KLCI index gained 9.39 points or 0.56% to 1,679.17 points on Monday. Trading volume increased to 2.50bn worth RM1.92bn. Market breadth was positive with 604 gainers as compared to 294 losers. Japanese stocks outperformed in region, with the Topix gaining 2.8% as all its sectors gained ground.

			In the period of 10 years, you can clearly see that Annjoo's share price didn't go anywhere other than oscillating between the range 0.63-4.06. As point 1 rightfully states, cyclicals expand and contract, then expand and contract again. 
						7.05% 
	 
	With all the above, I'm convinced to say that the prime time of steel stocks was over, the easy money has been made in the last cycle, steel stocks are currently into their downtrends. I'm not saying you cannot make money until the next big trend reversal, it's just that: 
	1. When buying cyclical stocks in uptrends, it's easy to make money. 
	2. On the other hand, when buying cyclical stocks in downtrends, it depends on how skilled you are in predicting ephemeral rebounds. I reckon that's not my game.

4235, LION INDUSTRIES CORP BHD ," Wed, 29 Aug 2018, 11:45 AM ",How Human Behaviour Affects Investment Decisions - Koon Yew Yin,,"
	The stock market is a constant puzzle. Many people asked me the following questions:   
	 
	As according to the company announcements my wife and I more than 150 million shares. We bought too many shares because it has very good profit when its power plant in Vietnam is completed. We were too greedy. When the price dropped due the claim by Star for late completion of the Star Tower, we need to sell some of our holdings to meet margin call and sole more to raise funds to buy Lion Industries when it was selling 70 sen per share which has very good profit growth prospect. It is not because Jaks is not good. We have too many shares. Unfortunately, this rapid price fall also cause many other shareholders to have margin call and they also have to sell. Forced selling is a vicious cycle. 
	If you have buying power, you should buy because it has fallen below Rm 100 and its latest announcement shows it has good profit.    
	 
	Within a few weeks, we have bought about 30 million Lion Industries shares. When I know that it will announce a reduced profit for the next quarter which will be announced before then end of the month, we sold some shares to raise funds so that we can buy it back at cheaper prices. Currently, it looks like the worst is over and the price is going higher. 
	You must bear in mind, that you are not in the same situation as I am. I have very large capital and I can take risk. But you should not simply follow what I do without thinking carefully.  
	 
	To be able to become a super investor we must be able to control our emotion of fear and greed. 
	Basic emotional responses and mental biases can influence the way we invest. Emotions and mental biases can get in the way of rational decision-making. Behavioural investing suggests reasons why some of our actions might be counterproductive to our goals. 
	Avoid the potential pitfalls we must stick to a long-term plan. Investors tend to make irrational decisions because of the following 3 concepts:  
	 
	With loss aversion, the pain of losses is more powerful than the pleasure of gains. This aversion to loss can contribute to panicked selling when the market drops or to the adoption of an overly conservative investment strategy to avoid short-term market fluctuations. These decisions may result in a portfolio that does not keep track with investment fundamentals. 
	 
	Investors tend to place greater weight on what they have experienced most recently, using it as a guideline for what might happen next. Known as recency bias, this theory may help explain why millennials who came of age soon after the financial crisis have steered clear of stocks as they have started investing—even though they have exceptionally long- time horizons when it comes to making more money. 
	 
	The idea with anchoring is that once you are exposed to an initial fact or figure, you will continue to look back to that information as a reference point. Individuals influenced by anchoring tend to hold on to an investment that has lost value in hopes that the investment will go back up to the original purchase price, rather than focusing on fundamentals. 
	While there is a natural human tendency to react emotionally to market swings, investors are encouraged to stick with a consistent, long-term investment strategy. This strategy can include techniques such as portfolio rebalancing, tactical allocation adjustments, or systematic investing—approaches that take market conditions into account without derailing a long-term plan.

	To answer this question, I will tell you the steel making process for producing   from iron ore and scrap. In the process, a lot of impurities such as nitrogen, silicon, phosphorus, sulphur and excess carbon are removed from the raw iron which are thrown out to the open shy. 
	By adding alloying elements such as manganese, nickel, chromium and vanadium to produce different grades of  . 
	China has been importing raw iron ore from Australia and coal from Indonesia to produce more than 50% of the total production of steel for the whole world. China has been exporting steel for a long time. 
	Under the clean sky policy, China has stopped importing iron ore and coal producing to produce steel. Instead, China imports hot iron briquetted iron (HBI). HBI is selling like hot cakes. Besides China, India is also importing a lot of HBI. 
	 
	The price of HBI has increased due to the increased price of scrapped iron. 
	Lion Industries has been showing increasing profit in the last 7 quarters. 
	In the past 2015 and 2016, the profit for all steel manufacturers was badly affected due to China’s dumping of steel. 
	Masteel reported that the Malaysian Government imposed anti-dumping tax for rebar 13.42% for the year ending April 13, 2018, followed by 12.27% and 11.1 % in the next two years respectively as well as additional 5% import duty to protect our local steel industry.

4235, LION INDUSTRIES CORP BHD ," Thu, 23 Aug 2018, 9:59 AM ",Lion Industries: A Smart Way to Trade - Koon Yew Yin,,"
	 
	For me to explain these human difficulties, I have to boast by telling you that I started buying Lion Industries shares a few weeks ago when it was selling at 70 sen and I have bought very aggressively. Now I have a total of 28 million Lion Industries shares. 
	With due respect to Mr Ooi Teik Bee, I started buying it before him. I started buying as soon as I see that it has reported increased profit and it is a good business with good profit growth prospect. 
	Mr Ooi’s method is very safe. He will only buy when its price has passed it 70 day moving average. As reported, Mr Ooi has bought 5.8 million shares for me. He has made profit for me and the value of my portfolio with him is more than Rm 20 million. 
	As reported Tabung Haji has sold its holdings on 10 , 13  and 17  August and it has 49.4 million shares left. 
	As I said above, you must be able to control your emotion and not be afraid to buy even if you see Tabung Haji is selling. This reminds me of my buying when EPF was selling VS Industry which I have explained in greater details below. 
	The price chart shows that it has dropped in the last few days because Tabung Haji has been selling. The total volume traded was 27.3 million shares when the price shot above Rm 1.20 per share. 
	 
	Even a very good share does not move up in a straight line. Occasionally, there will be more sellers than buyers causing the price to drop. When there are more buyers than sellers, the price will go higher. Many day traders take advantage of this phenomena, to make money. They buy during correction and sell when people are buying aggressively. 
	 
	Lion Industries 2017 annual report showed the substantial Shareholders as at 30 September 2017: 
	Substantial Shareholders  
	1.Tan Sri Cheng Heng Jem 216,865,498 
	2.Tan Sri Cheng Yong Kim 9,253,289  
	3.Dynamic Horizon Holdings Limited 74,472,627 
	4.Lembaga Tabung Haji 44,152,700 
	As you can see Tabung Haji has about 44 million shares in September last year, when the price was above Rm 1.40 and it must have bought more shares at higher prices to have more than 50 million shares before it started to sell.  
	I am not sure what is Tabung Haji’s average cost per share and whether it is making money to sell at this price level. 
	 
	 
	The chart below shows V S Industry went up from 30 sen in June 2014 to Rm 1.70 in Dec 2016, an increase of 550 % within 18 months. I was buying it when EPF was selling. Its 2015 annual report showed that I was the 2  largest shareholder, holding 102 million shares.     
	 
	I know instinctively when to buy and when to sell because I have been doing it for more than 35 years. It started serious share investment in 1983 when China gave notice to the British Government to recover ownership of Hong Kong. The Hang Sing Index plunged to 660 points. Who dared to buy shares when the Communists from China were going to control Hong Kong? 
	Within 3 years, I made so much money that I bought 46% of Kaiser Stocks and Shares Co Ltd, a stock broking company in Hong Kong.

	Month August also is the month where many listed companies in the Bursa will announced their quarterly report. And many investors in i3 are eagerly anticipating their favorite stocks result as fortune can be made or break with good or bad quarter result. 
	The current hottest stock is LIONIND, after many months of anticipating wait, finally Mr. Koon come up with his article on LIONIND on 17  and 18  August 2018 with his usual egotistic and provocative style: 
	 
	 
	I quote; “Many of my friends have also asked me if they should buy back at higher price if they have sold earlier. Of course, many shareholders would have sold too early and regret. A few smart one will dare to admit their mistake and buy back at higher price. In view of its good increasing profit growth, if you have sold, you should buy back” 
	“For example, I started buying Lion Industry as soon as I saw 2 consecutive quarters with increased profit. That means I started buying when it was selling at about 70 sen per share. Based on my buying method, I would be buying earlier than professional chartists who would only start to buy when the price passes its 70-day moving average, that is Rm 1.20 per share as shown by the price chart below, produced by the famous Mr. Ooi Teik Bee. I will not sell. In fact, I will buy more shares with margin loan.” 
	All hell breaks loose, recently Mr. Koon tell us he got margin call to sell JACKS now he encourage people to buy LIONIND when price already break RM1.20 while he already accumulated at RM 0.70 and some more saying he will buy more on margin loan. 
	I3 forumers and those felt cheated in JAKS waste no time in firing their comments and blogs at Mr. koon in all directions non-stop, you either with me or against me. It a war zones with no one care to look into whether LIONIND can sustain its earning moving forwards. Many had become the victims of collateral damage. Amidst all these heated war of words and noises hollandking had prompted the below question? 
	“Death to people has different meaning, some you die, you die and nothing left. Some, you die, you face judgment and ...... 
	But I have another theory, if world isn’t real, time is illusion, all are equals, does it mean our consciousness is shifting through these events/scenarios, you could go back to the past, you could be in the future....or you could repeat same thing over and over again.” 
	So the questions: Is the world real? Are we real? We are what we think or we think therefore we are? We controlled our mind or the mind controlled us? Can we stop for a moment without thinking? Are we real or just our imagination? (Illusion, delusion) Are we seeing and feeling things as what is truly there? Or are we seeing and feeling things as our own mind projection. Hence we see things as “self” or “other”, “pleasant” or “unpleasant” and rigidly divide people into “good” or “bad”, “friends” or “enemies” and thus fall under the sway of hatred, prejudice or attachment, greed, jealousy or pride and suffering will always be ready to appear. The mind is limitless and borderless as mind can travel through space and time and thus occasionally we feel the resentment/sorrow/sadness/joyous of the past and anxiety/worries/frightening/hopeful of the future. The mind sometime plays havoc with us and thus sometime we write/speech/act out of our mind or the mind inspired us to produce out of this world discovery/masterpiece. 
	 
	 
	Buddhism has some metaphysics explanation on beginning of universes and life. Teaching on how to control and harvest your mind potential. Gautama Buddha, commonly known as the Buddha (""the awakened one"") first teachings after achieved Enlightenment “The Four Noble Truths” 
	 
	 
	The cultivation of the noble eightfold path leads to the development of two acquired factors, which are right knowledge, or insight, and right liberation, or release. 
	Right knowledge is seeing things as they really are by direct experience, not as they appear to be, nor as the practitioner wants them to be, but as they truly are. A result of Right Knowledge is the tenth factor - Right liberation, this is where self-awakening occurs and the practitioner has reached the pinnacle of their practice. 
	For me, I believe; “Things are in a constant state of flux never still. It’s begins from emptiness, will end in emptiness and reemerge from emptiness. Life is cycles of birth and death. With death came others life, your losses is some other being gains. And the universal values of: Right view, Right intention, Right speech/writing, Right action and Right livelihood.” 
	Our nation will celebrate our Merdeka day on 31th August. We together had fought a good fight in GE14 and against all odds we prevailed thus able to reset our beloved Malaysia. 
	 
	 
	Are we as Malaysians and human being able to free our mind (  and reset our life views and become a better  ? 
	Thank you. 
	Note: 
	 
	 
	CSCSTEEL is mid stream steel player, bought HRC from the parent company at International market price and make it into cold rolled steel/pickled & oiled steel, galvanized steel and pre-painted galvanized steel to sell to the Malaysia manufacturing industries. Due to increase in HRC price and cheap import of CRC hence their profit margin suffered. 
	 
	ANJOO and LIONIND steel mills are upstream steel player where iron ore or scrap iron were manufactured into different steel product. 
	 
	 
	 
	 
	  
	LIONIND Annual report 2017 page 36:  
	The Hot Briquetted Iron (HBI) plant operated by Antara Steel Mills Sdn Bhd in Labuan, produces HBI (inset) mainly for the export market. 
	Amsteel Mills Sdn Bhd and Antara Steel Mills Sdn Bhd (Johor) produce long steel products namely billets, bars and wire rods for construction and manufacturing requirements. 
	The acquired Megasteel Banting steel mill produces flat steel HRC."

	浅谈4235 金狮工业 lionind Q3 2017 的业积: 
	A)公司于31-3-2017 的库存有4.69亿零吉,与31-12-2016 上一季增加了8千万. 
	應收款为4.61亿,与31-12-2016 上一季增加了2千万. 
	長短期借贷为2.4亿,与31-12-2016 上一季減少了1千7万. 
	现金有3.3亿,净现金8925万. 
	累计净利有4.37亿,与31-12-2016 上一季增加了4千9百万, 
	nta=rm2.51,与31-12-2016 上一季增加了9仙, 
	公司Q3 2017的赚副为6.45%,31-12-2016 上一季Q2 的赚副为8.6%, 
	B)lionind Q3 2017 赚4876万,EPS=7.16 SEN,三个季度累计EPS=14.64SEN, 
	估计全年EPS=20 SEN 可达标.PE=10,股价=RM2 
	投资路上选择对就简单了，坐享其成。 我相信是的,金狮工业仍然在物有所值内交易, 
	如2017财年eps=20sen, 
	现lionind rm1.20只在6倍的本益比(pe)交易,明显被低估了. 
	C)几年前金狮机构以每股1.4元賣回予钟老,心中有个底价了吧,今时钢价高漲已达净收区间,因此绝对高过这个价. 
	D)趁低吸购。这行业的股沒这么快走完，算到中途而己。 
	前方更美的景色还没抵达，耐心確保更好的丰收. 
	E)钢材保护税3年，直到2020年4月13日。第一年为13.42%，第二年降低至12.27%， 
	第三年则减少至11.1% 
	只供参考,进出自负. 
	Q4 业绩報捷

		在我就读土木工程系时，我其中一个课程是学习冶金，也就是研究如何制造金属，包括铁、钢、铜和其他金属。 
		中国的钢铁产量是全球总产量的50%，而且也是最大的钢铁出口国。 
		中国向澳洲购买铁矿，并向印尼购买煤炭。通过燃煤，可以将铁矿烧成铁。 
		加上二氧化碳，铁矿可以变成钢铁。 
		在这过程中，会产生许多气体和杂质进入大气层，因此，北京、上海和其他城市的天空总是暗暗的，空气也总是被污染。 
		既然几乎所有钢铁厂都是由政府持有，政府也下令许多钢铁厂停工。 
		目前，中国利用废铁和进口长铁来生产钢铁，供自用。中国不再出口钢铁。 
		 
		大马向来从中国进口钢铁，为了保护本地的钢铁生产商，政府也征收进口税。 
		这也是为何金狮工业（LIONIND，4235，主板工业产品股） 在过去数个季度取得盈利增长。 
		在首季，该公司的每股净利为4.08仙，第二季为8.20仙，到第三季，达到8.91仙。三季加起来的每股净利达21.19仙。 
		假设第四季的每股净利与第三季一样，全年的总每股净利将约30仙。 
		根据1.25令吉的股价，其本益比应为4倍，可以算是相当廉宜，特别是对一个有良好盈利展望的股项来说，这符合我的选股黄金原则。 
		我有义务通知大家，金狮工业是我其中一项主要投资。我这篇文章只是为了分享我的知识，而不是鼓励你买卖该股项。

4235, LION INDUSTRIES CORP BHD ," Sat, 18 Aug 2018, 10:29 AM ",Lion Industry: How to Recognise a Growth Stock Early? Koon Yew Yin,,"
	Although the title of this article reflects my egotistic manner and people do not like egoistic people, but it is ego that drives me to think and harder to make so many achievements. I was a co-founder of the 3 of the larger construction and property companies in Malaysia namely Mudajaya, Gamuda and IJM Corporation Bhd. 
	I am nearly 86 years old and I like to spread my accumulated knowledge to people, mush like a priest preaching the gospel. My intention is honourable.   
	 
	I am only a business man. As I am not an accountant, I can hardly understand a company’s balance sheet. I am also not a chartist. But then how could I buy so much of Latitude Tree, V S Industry and Lii Hen?  
	 
	The above chart shows that Latitude went up from Rm 1.00 to Rm 8.00, an increase of 800 % within 2.5 years. Its 2015 annual report showed that I was the 4  largest shareholder holding 6.32 million shares.    
	 
	The above chart shows VS Industry went up from 30 sen in June 2014 to Rm 1.70 in Dec 2016, an increase of 550 % within 18 months. Its 2015 annual report showed that I was the 2  largest shareholder, holding 102 million shares. 
	 
	The above chart shows that Lii Hen went up from 40 sen in mid 2013 to Rm 3.00 in Oct 2015, an increase of 750% within 2,5 years. Its 2015 annual report showed that I was the 2  largest shareholder, holding 19.80 million shares. 
	 
	As soon as I see any company with a good business reported 2 consecutive increasing quarterly profit and it is selling at P/E below 10, I will start to buy it. If it reports another quarter with increased profit, I will buy more aggressively. 
	For example, I started buying Lion Industry as soon as I saw 2 consecutive quarters with increased profit. That means I started buying when it was selling at about 70 sen per share. 
	Based on my buying method, I would be buying earlier than professional chartists who would only start to buy when the price passes its 70-day moving average, that is Rm 1.20 per share as shown by the price chart below, produced by the famous Mr Ooi Teik Bee. 
	 
	With due respect, like all professional Mr Ooi’s method is very safe to make money. 
	 
	Many day traders would sell as soon as they can make 30% profit. Assuming the bought it at 70 sen, they would start selling at about 90 sen. Statistics shows that day traders do not make much money because they sold too early and would not admit their mistake to buy back the share at higher prices. Most of them would like to boast to their friends that they have made 30% profit within 2 months of buying Lion Industry shares. 
	As long as Lion Industry continues to report increasing profit, I will not sell. In fact, I will buy more shares with margin loan. 
	I expect it will report increased profit before end of this month.

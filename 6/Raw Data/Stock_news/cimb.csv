1023, CIMB GROUP HOLDINGS BHD ," Wed, 8 May 2019, 10:36 AM ",Banking - OPR Cut,,"With market expectations largely mixed prior to this move, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) has gone ahead to cut the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) by 0.25%. Reasons cited were downside risks to growth from heightened uncertainties in the global and domestic environment, trade tensions and extended weakness in commodity-related sectors. The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor for the OPR are correspondingly reduced to 3.25% and 2.75% respectively. On face value, the move will be negative to the sector though impact will be fairly marginal. Preliminary estimates see banks’ profits lowered by about 3% (full-year effect), respective adjustments notwithstanding. Banks will most likely revise lending and saving rates in the coming days, possibly with 25bps seen on the assets and 22-23bps on the liabilities (savings), as was similarly adjusted in previous rounds. We maintain our  view on the sector, but with a positive bias given the sector’s lagging valuations to the broader market. For sector exposure, we still like despite its potential near-term weakness, and   for its medium-term earnings growth story. Source:   - 8 May 2019"

While Business moderated by 10bps to +4.5%, Households was flat at +5.3%. On a QoQ basis, loans continued to moderate at +0.5% QoQ (vs 4QCY18: +1.5% QoQ). On an annualized basis, loans saw uptick in March at +2.1% (vs Feb 19: +0.9% vs March 18:+ 4.8%). Moderation in Business was underpinned by working capital (March 19: +4.6% YoY vs Feb 19: +5.2% YoY and Construction (March 19: +1.1% vs Feb 19: +2.8% YoY while the flat Households was underpinned by resilient mortgages (flat at +7.1% YoY). However, HP continued to be in negative territory (-0.5% YoY vs Feb 19: -0.6% YoY) while Personal Financing moderated, falling below the +7% mark since Jul 18 at +6.5% YoY (vs Feb 19: +7.2% YoY). March 19 also saw repayments (+5.8% YoY vs Feb 19: +3.8% YoY) outpacing disbursements (+3.8% YoY vs (-2.3% YoY). Both Business and Household disbursements saw rebound in March 19 at +3.2% YoY and +5.7%, respectively, (vs Feb 19: -1.5% YoY and -4.4% YoY respectively). Overall net financing in the system shed another 30bps to +5.1% YoY with loans flat at +4.5% but corporate bonds shed 70bps to +7.1% YoY (vs Feb 19: +7.9% YoY). Weakening applications since early this year seemed receding as applications fell 6% YoY (vs Feb 19: -14% YoY vs Jan 19:-5% YoY) to RM72,080b. Business and Household applications fell 7.7% and 4.2% YoY respectively (vs Feb 19: -20.1% YoY and -7.4% YoY respectively). For Business, receding fall in applications can be seen in: (i) Working Capital (-1.1% YoY vs Feb 19: -15.2% YoY, (ii) non-residential (-6% YoY vs Feb 19: -16.5% YoY), and (iii) construction (-18.8% YoY vs Feb 19: -57.3% YoY). For Households, rebound in mortgages (+5.5% YoY vs Feb19: -0.7% YoY) mitigated the weakening applications. . Approvals in Mar 19 rebounded to +6.4% YoY with Business and Households rebounding at +10.6% YoY and +1.5% YoY respectively. For Business approvals strong rebound can be seen in purchase of transport vehicles (+85.5% YoY vs Feb 19: -16.3% YoY) with purchase of non-residential rising sharply at +65.2% YoY vs Feb 19: +0.7% YoY). For Households, rebound in approvals for mortgages and HP (+1.9% YoY and +10.4% YoY vs Feb 19: -9.0% YoY and -9.7% YoY) supporting Households approvals. . Liquidity in the system continued to improve as excess liquidity improved by 30bps to 11.3% to RM213b. As loans moderated, deposits followed the moderating theme, slowing by 11bps to +5.8% YoY (Feb 19: +6.9% YoY) with moderation coming from fall in State Government deposits’ at 8% YoY to RM30,766b (vs Feb 19: -4.6% YoY). Loan-to-fund (LTF) ratio and loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) were relatively stable at 82% and 89%, respectively. Average lending rate saw a 1bps uptick for Mar 19 to 5.03%, with 3-month deposit shed 1bps to 3.15% putting downside pressure on NIM. . March 19 saw a 2bps improvement as Gross Impaired Loans (GIL) fell to 1.46%. Both Business and Household improved (shedding by 2 and 3bps, respectively) at 1.84% and 1.08%, respectively. Overall both Net Impaired and Gross Impaired loans fell 2.7% YoY and 2.6% YoY, respectively. . We still believe that 2019 loans will be supported by a resilient household on account of accommodative interest rates and stable asset quality. Improving asset quality leading to higher approvals will lend support for household demand. Despite the positive domestic news-flow lately, further external risks might put a dampener on business sentiments with softer demand and applications with higher risk perceived lowering approval rates. While we view that banks will still maintain selective asset quality, the stable system asset will see continued demand from the resilient households especially demand for residential property and personal financing (from quality borrowers).

The consumer price index rose by 0.3% in April after climbing by 0.4% in March. Energy prices showed another substantial increase during the month, surging up by 2.9% in April after jumping by 3.5% in March. A 5.7% spike in gasoline prices account for over two-thirds of the increase by the headline index. Excluding food and energy prices, core consumer prices inched up by 0.1 percent for third consecutive month compared to economist estimates for a 0.2% uptick. Higher prices for shelter, medical care, education, and new vehicles more than offset significant decreases in prices for used cars and trucks and apparel. Consumer prices in April were up by 2.0% YoY, reflecting a modest acceleration from the 1.9 YoY growth in March. (RTT)  President Donald Trump said that the US will boost its purchases of domestic farm products for humanitarian aid in an effort to offset lost demand from China as trade tensions flare between the nations. Trump said that the US will use its money from the tariffs to buy American agricultural products “in larger amounts than China ever did” and send it to “poor & starving countries” for humanitarian aid. The president indicated potential purchases of USD15bn from farmers. (The Edge)  German exports rose unexpectedly in March, raising hopes that a slowdown in Europe’s largest economy will not significantly dent growth in the 1Q despite headwinds from unresolved trade disputes. Seasonally adjusted exports rose by 1.5% in March, while imports were up 0.4%. That meant the trade surplus edged up to EUR 20.0bn (USD 22.45bn) from EUR 18.7bn in Feb. The government has slashed its 2019 growth forecast to 0.5%. (Reuters)  Japanese wages fell for a third straight month in March, marking the worst 1Q in a decade and casting fresh doubt on whether the tight labor market will push up pay significantly.

Economists have treated recent wage data with caution after sampling problems led to a string of revisions. Household spending rose 2.1%, compared with a 1.6% estimate. Japan needs solid household spending to support the economy amid recent weakness in exports. Slower overseas demand is weighing on factory output and capital investment, but improved consumption could help keep 1Q economic growth positive.

1023, CIMB GROUP HOLDINGS BHD ," Wed, 8 May 2019, 9:08 AM ","Banking - a 25 Bps Rate Cut, Not Really a Surprise",25bps Rate Cut in Response to a Moderating 1Q19 Domestic Economy Short-term Impact on Banks’ Net-interest-margin (NIM) Higher Impact on Banks With a More Asset-sensitive Balance Sheet,"On 7 May, BNM decided to reduce the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) from 3.25% to 3.0%. Though a 25bps cut is not sharp, it could however put some short term pressure on the banks’ net interest margins (NIM). Over the next 6-12 months, NIM pressure may gradually ease as the repricing impact of deposit rates take effect. We estimate that banks may experience about a 1.4-3.9% full-year impact on 2019-20E net profit, on a pro-forma basis. Among the banking stocks, Alliance Bank may see more immediate impact on their net profit due to its more asset-sensitive balance sheet. We maintain  on the banking sector, noting that the rate cut is expected to support overall domestic growth in 2019. Our top picks:  and  . On 7 May, BNM has decided to cut the OPR by 25bps (to 3.0%), ahead of the expected release of the country’s 1Q GDP growth numbers on 16 May. Though our house view was that the OPR would stay unchanged, it was nevertheless not a surprise given the widespread anticipation by the street and moderation in domestic economic activities in 1Q19. In the policy statement, BNM highlighted the risk of moderation in global growth going forward of which could affect the country’s external sector. Our economics team expects that there will be no further rate cuts for the rest of 2019, given our country’s low inflation and resilient household/private capital spending. The OPR cut would result in some downward pressure on NIM, which will be more prominent in the first 3 to 6 months given the immediate repricing effects of -25bps on existing variable rate loans (details Fig 1) and for new loans. Based on the respective bank’s fixed deposits (FDs) and NIDs maturity profile, this would determine how much interest rate risks a particular bank is exposed to. Based on Fig 4, between 72.7% to 80.7% of banks’ FDs and NIDs have maturity within 6 months, implying that NIM may start normalizing after 6 months as deposit rates are repriced down. Based on our simulation of a 25bps cut in interest rates on our universe banks’ net profits and NIM (Fig 1), the net profit impact ranged from -1.4% to -3.9%. Banks with a more asset-sensitive balance sheet, i.e. a greater proportion of variable-rate loans against fixed-rate loans in their portfolio, such as Alliance Bank and CIMB may see a higher net profit impact of -3.9% and -3.2% for FY19E, based on a full-year impact assumption. Hong Leong Bank, AMMB and Public Bank may see less impact of a 25bps cut on earnings. Source:   - 8 May 2019"

1023, CIMB GROUP HOLDINGS BHD ," Wed, 8 May 2019, 8:51 AM ","Banking - Short-Term Muted, Likely Favourable LongTerm",,"Bank Negara Malaysia lowered the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) yesterday to 3.00% (from 3.25%), marking its first rate decrease since July 2016. The development is negative in the short-term to Malaysian banks as Net Interest Margin (NIM) will compress following the almost immediate re-pricing downwards of floating-rate loans and lag in the re-pricing of fixed-rated deposits (FD). Negligible decrease in costs relating to demand and saving deposits (CASA) also support the NIM compression. Based on latest reported results, AFFIN (33%), MBSB (60%) and MAYBANK (31%) (vs. industry average of 29%. had the highest percentage composition of fixed rated loans as at 31 December 2018. Meanwhile, ABMB and CIMB take the cake in terms of lower composition of FD/CASA. According to our analysis (see Table 1), MBSB and MAYBANK emerge as the biggest beneficiaries with MBSB’s loans/financing 60% are being fixed-rated whilst MAYBANK comes second in terms of loans being fixed rated (31%) with 32% of its deposits in the form of CASA and 81% of its FDs maturing by June 19 (6 months tenure from Dec 18). As a result, both MBSB and MAYBANK’s net interest margins are expected to compress the least, all else being equal. However, since Dec 19, at least 5 banks have raised their Base Lending Rate (BLR) ranging from 10bps to 13bps notably; AFFIN, CIMB, HLBANK, RHBBANK (+10bps) with BIMB (+13bps) – coupled with the 25bps hike in Feb 18 following the OPR hike in Jan 18 - which will help to minimise NIM compression due to the lag in re-pricing of FDs. In this aspect, repricing of fixed rated deposits will be swifter in CIMB, HLBANK and MAYBANK as >80% of their 6-month FDs mature in June 2019, minimising the impact further for both CIMB and HLBANK. On the upside, domestic fair value through profit & loss (FVTPL) and fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)) debt instruments are poised to register a one-time mark-to-market gain to the mild rate reduction. At first glance (see Table 1), BIMB will be the most impacted as it has the highest percentage composition of FVTPL and FVOCI against its total assets, while the least affected is MBSB. However, given the high volatility nature of this asset class, assessing this segment may be difficult. Nonetheless, given that the contribution of non-interest income is usually significantly more than 30% of the total income, the unrealised gain impact may not be as material as thought. Lower lending rates may bolster credit demand and hence loans growth. Besides, the trend could lead to a higher pool of borrowers, causing demand to intensify and Average Lending Rates (ALR) to go up. Hence, any short-term compression in NIMs may potentially be lowered if not wiped out. This may cause NIMs to rise above pre-OPR hike levels once FD rates adjust to the new lower rates (three to 6 months down the road). However, historical data of ALR vs. OPR (as depicted below) does not seem to support this where rise in ARL was minimal despite OPR being lowered in 2016 as external/internal headwinds plaguing loans growth (coupled with banks selective on asset quality). However, lower interest rates will also likely result in lower credit costs as non-performing loans decrease. This, in turn, may result in banks lowering their credit scoring and approval criteria, which will give much-needed impetus to loans growth. As the long-term impact is unclear, we refrain from making any changes to our FY19E earnings; hence, our valuations are maintained for now. While forward earnings will be negative, loans growth and credit costs might shift towards a positive bias due to the impact of lower interest rates. We have  call for most of the banking stocks in our universe. However, valuations seem more attractive with most of the banking stocks under our coverage rated as  The remainders are  as valuations are relatively stretched, in our view.

Deposit pressure is prevailing in Malaysia and Indonesia (undermining NIM) with Thailand’s NIM pressure coming from the switch to safer but lower yielding loans. .

Provisions fell - 16.2%yoy on continuous effort to improve its asset quality. Gross NPL improved by -7bps qoq and -47bps yoy to 3.04%.  Gross NPL for corporate and commercial as at 1QFY19 was 1.0% and 7.7% respectively. This had improved from 1.9% and 8.8% respectively as at 1QFY18. Meanwhile, there was an increase in MSME segment from 3.0% as at 1QFY18 to 3.6% as at 1QFY19. Consumer segment remained stable at 2.4%.  NIM improved by +18bps yoy to 5.28% which resulted in NII growing by +0.2%yoy. However, the NII growth was an improvement from the contraction seen in FY18. We opine that this could be due to loans finally being re-priced higher. We believe that NII growth could have been better if loans grew stronger. Loans expanded +5.0%yoy to IDR187.99t as at 1QFY19, supported by expansion in mortgages (+13.1%yoy to IDR31.03t) and SME (+8.1%yoy to IDR29.78t).  NOII expanded +4.0%yoy mainly due to higher forex & fixed income derivatives income and arranger & syndication fees. These grew +9.8%yoy to IDR258b and +241%yoy to IDR106b respectively.  Our concern in regards to deposits remains as deposits contracted slightly by -0.5%yoy to IDR190.6t. This was due to decline of -8.5%yoy to IDR48.1t in current account deposits. However, it was moderated by the +2.8%yoy to IDR54.3t and +2.4%yoy to IDR88.2t growth in savings and fixed deposits respectively. Source:   - 26 Apr 2019"

CIMB Niaga, a 92.5% subsidiary of CIMB Group recorded a core net profit (CNP) of IDR941b for 3M19 which was in line with market expectations accounting for 26% of full-year estimates. s . Topline improved +9% primarily due to due to better NOII (+32%) to IDR4.67t as NII was flat at IDR3.0t. The weak NII was due higher COF (surging by 12bps) despite loans improved by +5% (within guidance). Earnings (+7) were slower than topline due to i) higher opex (+6%) and higher operating losses of IDR561b (vs 1Q18 losses of IDR209b). Asset quality continued to improve with GIL down 46bps to 3.05% with credit charge down 28bps to 1.6% (within guidance of <1.8%). as topline improved +22% thanks to NOII rebounding (+98%) to IDR1.63t (the strongest ever in the last 5 years). While generally a weak quarter, NII rebounded (+1.3%) attributed to better NIM (+7bps) to 5.05% as loans were flat. The strong topline did not translate into an equally strong bottomline due to the operating loss of IDR561b, despite impairment allowances fell 14%. From the preceding quarter, asset quality continued to improve as GIL fell 49bps to 3.05% with credit charge falling 26bps to 1.6%. We understand previously that loans will still be in the mid-single digit space as Niaga wont be participating in the infra loans space; focused on the consumer and SME space and less on commercial and corporate sectors so as to strengthened asset quality. 1Q19 NIM expansion was a surprise (as we expected for flattish NIM) due to repricing of assets; but management guided for higher funding costs ahead which we believe due higher deposits intake (as LDR at >100% vs 94% a year ago). On a positive note improved fee-based income indicate an improved capital market activities ahead and likely picking up with conclusion of the recent Indonesian Presidential elections. Niaga’s results are within expectations and guidance. Historically Niaga’s contribution to the Group is at 20~%). FY18 PBT contribution was at 20%. The Group’s 3M19 results are expected at the end of next month, thus FY19E earnings of RM4.7b are maintained for now; based on the following assumptions: (i) loans growth of ~5.5%, (ii) NIM compression at 10bps, and (iii) credit charge of 45bps. based on an unchanged target PBV of 1.0x implying a 0.5SD-level below its 5-year mean to reflect the on-going challenges and prevailing volatilities.

		2018年对联昌集团来说，像是坐过山车，也是集团进入T18转型期的最后阶段，全球宏观经济形势料影响集团前进的步伐，东盟两大贸易伙伴：中美之间的贸易战，影响市场情绪与走势。 
		虽然面对强大逆风，集团努力落实T18目标，包括在东盟各成员国建立分行，一旦完成T18目标，集团探讨落实下一个中期成长策略，名为“Forward23”，主要以5大方向为基础：顾客为核心、永续经营、投资与伙伴联系、科技与数据，还有以人为本，带领顾客和社会前进。 
		在扩展业务与分行，集团于2018年12月初，在菲律宾推出数码零售银行业，这是集团在东盟市场建立分行的第10国，同时也在越南胡志明市设立分行。 
		在工业革命4.0迅速革新的道路上，联昌集团与伙伴发挥各自实力，以保持竞争力，2018年这方面的合作已看到成果，并促成越界速寄付款，与Ant Financial联营合作，推出一触即通卡，联昌证券已敲定和中国银河的合作，这项交易的敲定大约花了两年时间。 
		类似的策略伙伴联系，推动集团继续成长，除了专营业务，也包括探讨传统银行以外的商机，为培训人才和步入下一个成长阶段，集团已拨款7500万令吉给联昌集团3D学院为期3年，专注培训具备数码专业技术的人才，放眼2023年之前，至少15%的员工拥有这方面的专长。 
		在业绩表现方面，集团赚取174亿令吉营运收入，比前期减少1.4%，主因是市况较弱，不过，出售CIMB Principal资产管理（CPAM）公司，获得9亿2800万令吉，冲淡影响效应，净盈利56亿令吉，按年比成长24.8%，促使股东回酬11.4%，每股盈利得59.7仙。 
		印尼业务税前盈利跌1.6%，若以印尼盾计、税前盈利改善11.4%；泰国分行业务相当理想，税前盈利增长116.8%；此外，新加坡分行业务税前盈利成长23.7%，柬埔寨业务表现超预期。 
		泰国在2019上半年举行大选，印尼将在4月选出新总统，菲律宾将在5月举行投票，预计在大选后，这些国家的宏观经济政策不会有大转变。 
		美国和英国一系列政治发展事件，预计将导致全球经济展望保持看淡，英国的脱欧计划，以及在脱欧后可能面对不稳定局面，这一连串事件预料促使2019年形势继续看淡。 
		世界银行指出，接下来2年，全球成长偏弱，世界两大经济体需求减少，新兴市场和发展中经济体，如大马、印尼、泰国和柬埔寨，将面对不利冲击，东盟贸易中心新加坡也不例外。 
		虽然市场看淡，银行业整体展望仍保持乐观，在数码科技影响下，银行将继续革新和转型，以为股东塑造价值，基于这点，接下来2年在数码科技的投资，将增加集团的营运开销，股东回酬可能持平。

1023, CIMB GROUP HOLDINGS BHD ," Mon, 22 Apr 2019, 10:06 AM ",Construction & Property - Bandar Malaysia “Revived”,,"The Government announced last Friday that it has decided to reinstate the Bandar Malaysia Project that was terminated in May 2017, and which also retain IWH-CREC Sdn Bhd as the project’s master developer. IWH-CREC is a joint venture entity between Iskandar Waterfront Holdings Sdn Bhd (IWH) and China Railway Engineering Corp (CREC), a joint venture (JV) formed to take up 60% of Bandar Malaysia Sdn Bhd. The project, which was thought to have an estimated gross development value (GDV) of up to RM200bn earlier is now reported to have GDV of RM140bn, and will see some adjustments to its original plan, which include the construction of a People’s Park, 10,000 units of affordable homes, Bumiputra participation throughout the project, and priority for the use of local content in the construction process. This development comes as a positive surprise and undoubtedly brightens the prospects of the local construction sector. Nevertheless, details of the project particularly on the cost remains unknown pending finalization by the consortium. While we maintain our  ratings on both sectors at this juncture, trading opportunities abound, particularly for construction-related stocks.  In July last year, the ministry’s officials disclosed that there were “zero” developers who had expressed interest in the project. Reinstatement of this project is an obvious shot-in-the-arm, particularly to the local construction sector. Given the greenfield nature of this project, players exposed to the initial infrastructure-based phases (access roads, earthworks, water and sewerage treatment plants, substantial piling works) could be sizeable opportunities. Within our universe, big names like Gamuda, IJM Corporation and  Specialist contractors such as Advancecon Holdings (not rated) for earthworks, Econpile Holdings (not rated) and Pintaras Jaya (not rated) for piling, Lafarge Cement (not rated) and Tasek Corporation (not rated) could also be beneficiaries. This “re-award” to the IWH-CREC Sdn. Bhd. consortium which was chosen in an international open tender exercise participated by over 40 world renowned companies, including from Japan, Australia and the Middle East is expected to rerate Iskandar Waterfront Holdings (not rated). That said, details are still light at this juncture on the actual investment/land cost the JV is forking out for the mammoth development. Other beneficiaries in our view are Malaysian Resources Corporation (not rated) which was the joint-venture partner under the Bandar Malaysia Integrated Transportation Terminal and MMC Corporation (not rated) for the potential revival of Bandar Malaysia MRT 2 underground stations. Back in 2016, we understand that IWH-CREC also signed an MoU with a consortium of international Chinese and Malaysian banks to provide funding for investors in the Bandar Malaysia project which included local banks such as CIMB Bank, Malayan Banking, RHB Bank and  As such, we do not discount the participation of local banks to fund the development. As for the property sectors, we believe the impact will be muted, given current oversupply of commercial space and soft demand due to affordability and financing issues. That said, the spillover effect (i.e. high value job creations) from the development should be positive to spur the demand especially the high-end segment in the long term. Source:   - 22 Apr 2019"

Fund-based income improvement was supported by higher loans (+16%) despite NIM shedding 105bps to 3.8% due to higher funding costs. Opex saw a 6ppt uptick, in line with the bank’s transitional expenses. Asset quality improved as Gross Impaired Loans (GIL) fell 90bps to 4.3% with credit costs falling 51bps to 1.7% (vs. estimate of >2% due to higher provisioning in preparation of FRS9). CNP of THB325m rebounded from negative territory, due to falling impairment allowances (-39%) and gains from NPL sales. Topline fell (-3%) to THB3.21b as both fund-based and fee-based income fell 3% and 1%, respectively. The weak fund-based income was dragged by falling NIMs (54bps) to 3.8% with slower loans (+2%), for the 3rd consecutive period despite the accommodative interest rates. Asset quality continued to be stable with GIL stable at 4.3% and credit charge falling 120bps to 1.7%. (The higher base of 2.9% before was due to provisioning in preparation of FRS9 in 2020). We maintained our view of uptick in credit charge due to the new guidelines from the BOT (FRS9 provisioning). Double-digit loans growth was a surprise but was due to a lower base as 1Q is generally a weak quarter. Loans will likely moderate (from SMEs and corporates); but expected to be driven by consumer demand (as interest rates are still accommodative despite the 25bps hike to 1.75% in Dec 2018). We also expect downside pressure on NIM due to competitive lending ahead. We maintain our view of improved FY19 earnings ahead at THB790m based on these assumptions; (i) loans growth of <6%, (ii) NIM at <4.0%, (iii) credit costs at 230bps, (iv) CIR at 57%, and (v) tax rate at <22%. for the Group, as historically CIMB Thai’s contribution to the Group is minimal (at <7%). FY18 PBT contribution was at 6%.

At RM6.10 we maintained our TP based on a target PBV of 1.0x implying a 0.5SD-level below its 5-year mean to reflect the on-going challenges and volatility ahead.

On an annualized basis, loans growth moderated to +0.9% (vs Jan 19: +3.6% vs Feb 18: +4.5%)  While moderation was broadbased for Business, loans in the construction sector took the hardest hit slowing by 5ppts to +2.8% YoY (vs Jan 19: +7.9% YoY). Slowdown in Households was also broad-based with the exception of HP, which drifted by another 30bps to -0.6% YoY (Jan 19: -0.3% YoY). Feb 19 also saw repayments (+3.8% YoY vs Jan 19: +14.2% YoY) outpacing disbursements (-2.3% YoY vs +11% YoY). Both Business and Households disbursements fell in Feb 19 (-1.5% YoY and -4.4% YoY respectively vs Jan 19: +12.8% YoY and +6.3% YoY). Overall net financing in the system shed 10bps to +5.4% YoY with loans growth slipping by 50bps to +4.5% YoY (Jan 19: +5.0% YoY) but corporate bonds saw an uptick (+60bps vs Jan 19: -70bps) to +7.9% YoY.  For Business, falling applications were evident in construction falling by 57% YoY (vs Jan: +58% YoY) to RM1.53b. For Households, falling applications were evident in Personal Financing (-15% YoY vs +0.3% YoY), HP (-12% YoY vs Jan 19: -8% YoY) and credit card (-18% YoY vs Jan 19: -14% YoY).  Compounding further the moderation in loans growth was falling approvals (-6.7% YoY vs -4.8% YoY) with Business approvals saw a moderate decline (-3.1% YoY vs Jan 19: -8.3% YoY) to RM11,968b whilst Households fell steeply (- 10.2% YoY vs Jan: -0.9% YoY) to RM11,306b. Due to falling applications outpacing falling approvals, approval rate in the system surged by 6ppt to 47% as both Business and Household surged to 50% and 44%, respectively (vs Jan 19: 45% and 42%, respectively).  Liquidity in the system continued to improve as excess liquidity improved by 40bps to 11.0% to RM207b. Deposits bucked the moderating theme, improving by 20bps to +6.9% YoY, with higher deposits from the Federal Government and Others at +25% and +7% to RM25,817b and RM105,931b, respectively (Jan 19: +2.3% YoY and +5.8% YoY respectively). Loan-to-fund (LTF) ratio and loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) were relatively stable at 83% and 89%, respectively. Average lending rate retreated by 2bps for Feb 19 to 5.02%, as was the 3-month deposit which shed 1bps to 3.16% alleviating downside pressure on NIM.  February 19 saw a 3bps uptick in Gross Impaired Loans (GIL), led by Business (+6bps uptick to 1.86%) while Household saw a 2bps uptick to 1.11%. Net Impaired loans saw a 2bps to 0.93%. Overall on a year to year basis, asset quality seemed contained as Net Impaired and Gross Impaired was at 0.94% and 1.55%, respectively, in Feb 18.  Despite the weak sentiments from Households, we believe that 2019 loans will be supported by a resilient household on account of accommodative interest rates and stable asset quality. Further external risks might put a dampener on business sentiments with softer demand and applications with higher risk perceived lowering approval rates. The dampening credit demand might be exacerbated by an increase in corporate bonds as upside pressure on interest rates lessens. While we view that banks will still maintain selective asset quality, the stable system asset will see continued demand from the resilient households especially demand for residential property and personal financing (from quality borrowers). The contained asset quality should support the growth from households as banks will have a healthier appetite for household loans. Although personal loans and credit cards are on the downtrend, we believe banks will continue to grow these two spaces as asset quality from these spaces are still contained with GIL at 2.1% and 0.92%, respectively (down by 9bps and 25bps, respectively) from a year ago. Approval rate for personal loans/credit card improved/ remained stable at 35%/38%.  with no visible catalyst/potential game changer ahead. Our Neutral view maintained and overall risk looks stable. Our view of moderate loans growth still holds; thus, we maintain a Neutral outlook for the sector. However, valuations seem more attractive and most of the banking stocks under our coverage are rated as OUTPERFORM except for CIMB (TP: RM6.10), HLBANK (TP: RM20.60), PBBANK (TP: RM24.10) and RHBBANK (TP: RM5.80) which are at MARKET PERFORM.

1023, CIMB GROUP HOLDINGS BHD ," Thu, 28 Mar 2019, 9:10 AM ",Banking - BNM Financial Stability Review 2018,,"yesterday emphasising again the soundness, stability and resilient of the domestic banking system. The domestic financial market conditions remained orderly supported by strong domestic financial institutions. Market risk exposures were at manageable levels due to prudent risk management with lower risks seen from external borrowings. Strong capital and liquidity buffers are supporting the resiliency of the banking system while liquidity and funding conditions remained conducive for financial intermediation activities. The report highlighted that  in line with income growth. Debt repayments continued to be supported by income and employment growth. Despite healthy financial buffers, BNM highlighted that lower income households remain vulnerable but their share of household debt declined due to implementation of responsible lending standards. Despite overall quality of household debt remaining sound, BNM sees that certain households are showing sign of difficulty in servicing their debt. House prices continued to ease as demand for high-end properties softened due to affordability issue for most buyers. BNM sees that demand for owner-occupied housing to outstrip supply but believes with better alignment and coordination from the Government and developers to align demand and supply, the housing market will improve. From BNM’ sensitivity analysis, the domestic banks capital buffers are sufficient to withstand the property market broad price correction plus potential spill-over to other sectors. Credit risk from households, property market and non-financial corporations to remain stable. However, risks from the property market are elevated with levels of unsold housing units expected to rise in the short-term. Incoming supply from office space and shopping complex are compounding the risks. Market, liquidity & funding and contagion risks, on the other hand, are expected to remain stable. Strong domestic institutional investors and financial institutions are expected to remain supportive with ample liquidity on the back of attractive valuations. Loan-to-Fund (LTF) and Loan-to-equity (LTFE) are sustained at levels of 80% and 70%, which are supportive of the banks’ critical needs. Contagion risks from NBFIs are expected to remain low with the strengthening of governance and management of NBFIs to support improvement in performance and resilient of NBFIs. BNM sees 2019 business activity to be supported by sustained demand and continued income and employment growth with downside risks coming from external conditions i.e. slower global growth, trade war and volatility in commodity prices. . 2018 saw household debt moderating further (+4.7% YoY) as loans from NBFI’s slowed. For 2018, household debt to GDP declined by 80bps to 83%. Residential property loans remained the main contributor to household debt. With income and employment stable, households continue to manage their debt payments. While Household financial assets expanded at a slower pace (dropping by 340bps to +5.0% YoY) ratio of household assets to debt remained high at 4x. Financial assets and liquid financial assets (LFA) to debt remained resilient at 2.1x and 1.4x, respectively. Higher risks remained for those earnings household debt remaining elevated, BNM sees financial stability risks being mitigated, as debt expanded in line with income. Exposures of financial institutions to households have reduced with 2/3 of household lending secured by property and securities. Vigilance in prudent lending and risk management are still in place with 70% of newly approved loans’ Debt-toService ratios (DSR) remaining below 60%.  with both aggregate impairment ratio and aggregate delinquency ratio improving and stable at 1.2%. However, risks can be seen from: (i) lower-income borrowers (500k mortgages, (iii) borrowers depending on variable income sources, and (iv) urban dwellers experiencing higher cost of living. From its own stress scenarios, BNM expects banks to remain resilient to potential losses. Potential losses of between RM60-RM108b are manageable as these are within the banks’ excess capital buffers which stood at RM143b as of end-2018. . BNM’s sensitivity analysis of large non-financial corporation (NFC) shows that banks will be able to withstand potential credit losses (from severe shocks) from these borrowers. Estimated potential losses are estimated to about 1/3 of the banks’ capital buffers. Post shock, these borrowers may face short-term liquidity constraints but will be able to meet debt obligations from earnings with their interest coverage ratio at 2.2x. continues to show resilience of the banking system. Domestic banks remained wellpositioned to absorb potential losses using the capital and earnings buffers with post-stress capital ratios well above the minimum regulatory requirements. Under the most adverse scenarios, gross impairment ratios rose to 8.6%. Under its Adverse Scenario 2, 56% of total losses are due to banks’ exposure to business driven by large NFC borrowers with weak financial standing. Exposures to households contributed to 35% of total losses. Over a third of these household losses comes from borrowers with in our views of moderate loans ahead with growth driven by the resilient household as income and employment continue to be stable. Further external risks might put a dampener on business sentiments with softer demand and applications with higher risk perceived lowering approval rates. The dampening credit demand might be exacerbated by an increase in corporate bonds as upside pressure on interest rates lessens. While we view that banks will still maintain selective asset quality, the stable system asset qualities will see continued demand from the resilient households especially demand for residential property and personal financing (from quality borrowers). Affordable housing (<500k) will be the driver of mortgage loans given the lower risks perceived from this segment. Source:   - 28 Mar 2019"

In our view, the core operatiions were relatively weak in 2018, with operating income (excluding disposal gains) down 7.4% yoy due to weaker fund-based income (-2.8% yoy) and non-interest income (-19% yoy). Despite a robust group loan growth of 7.0% yoy (driven by strong loan growth in Malaysia, which was up 10% yoy), it did not help cushion the deposit cost pressure from CIMB Niaga (Indonesia), which dampened NIM from 2.63% in 2017 to 2.5% in 2018 (-13bps yoy). The 2018 CIR ended at 52.6%, however, against its KPI of 50% under the T18 financial targets. We anticipate a moderation in business activities in 2019, in Malaysia (as business sentiment remains cautious due to the global trade slowdown and geopolitical uncertainties) and Indonesia (1H19 likely to be affected by uncertainties prior to the general election in April 2019). On a more positive note, CIMB’s management has unveiled its longer-term KPIs, based on a new forward aspiration scheme, i.e. Forward 23 (2023 KPI: CIR 45%; CET1 13%; ROE 12-13%). Maintain HOLD.

We understand the NIM compression was a combination of the aggressive policy rate hikes by Bank Indonesia and as a result of the management's focus on improving asset quality.

CNP growth of +17% YoY was primarily driven by lower impairment allowances (-19% YoY) as top-line slumbered. . Top-line rebounded 1.6% primarily due to better NOII (+16.8%) to IDR4.48t as NII fell 3.2% to IDR12.0t. The weak NII was due to slower loans (by 100bps to +1.8% and below guidance of mid- single digit growth) and falling NIMs (-30bps to 4.9% (as guided). Loans were below guidance as management focused on strengthening asset quality, rebalancing its portfolio. As such, asset quality continued to improve with GIL down 64bps to 3.1% with credit charge down 43bps to 1.78% (within guidance). (27% vs. 3Q18: 32%). While top-line was down (-12% due to drag in NOII at -36%; the weakest quarter), operating profit was up by 5% due to gains in operating income. The quarter saw loans rebounded (+3%) but NIMs was marginally stable, which saw NII down by 1%. The quarter also saw asset quality mixed with GIL down by 30bps to 3.1% but credit charge up by 12bps to 1.9%.  As guided by management, Niaga’s 2019 earnings looks challenging with loans stifled by: ((i) upcoming impending elections, and ((ii) Niaga not participating in the infra loans space. Loans will be focused on the consumer and SME space and less on commercial and corporate sectors so as to focus on strengthening asset quality. While FY19E NIM is expected at ~5%, we do not discount of additional downside pressure on NIM on account of competitive pricing. While asset quality YoY showed improvement, with management targeting credit charge <1.8%, we do not discount uptick ahead as consumers suffer from a slowdown in the economy. we wait for its 12M18 results expected at the end of the month. As results were in line, Niaga’s PBT contribution to the Group level is likely at ~18% (9M18: 18%).

		2018戊戌年，“土狗”睽违12载再度值班，孰不知敏锐嗅觉却因久休上演失灵记，丝毫嗅不出国内和国外蠢蠢欲动的危机，让全球投资者置身于危险之中而不自知，个个跌得狗吃屎。 
		送走失职的狗，大地今年将迎来好吃懒做的“土猪”，胖嘟嘟的身躯会否拖累股市前进的脚步，让股市陷入跑不动而任人宰割的猪市？ 
		马股在鸡年展翅高飞，孰不知狗年却在国内政权变天，以及国外贸易战硝烟密布下，吓得急跳墙，投资者无不爬上救生梯逃命去。 
		经历过“鸡飞狗走”的考验，马股迈入己亥猪年市况会否改善，甚至出现2008年丁亥猪年全年上扬153.85点或12.19%，投资者们无不“猪笼入水”、“发过猪头”的景况？ 
		从一众投资大行报告来看，己亥猪年“猪肥屋润”几率甚低，更怕中国与美国贸易摩擦、英国“脱欧”、货币波动等诸多不确定性因素长存，让全球股市大发猪瘟。在猪瘟来势汹汹下，投资者该如何免疫？ 
		答案就是“Pick”。狗年股市惨跌，让许多股票开始浮现价值，而这些安全性高的价值股，也是资金的避风港，值得投资者守“猪”（株）待兔。 
		 
		不过，读者们可别误会是猪年买股，等到兔年才能卖，实则是投资者们宜在猪年选择以守为攻，趁低吸纳基本面强劲，但估值却遭到低估的股项，等待吐气扬眉之日的到来。 
		那么，有那些股具备守“猪”待兔的潜能？《投资致富》特意比对12家大行投资首选名单，精挑细选出13只“猪”事大吉的股项来帮助投资者持盈保泰。 
		 
		 
		 
		联昌集团狗年流年不利，不仅出现重大人事变动，就连大股东——国库控股也喊卖，拖累狗年股价下滑19.83%。不过，这家银行老二迈入土猪年，被诸多大行看好将上演大翻身，全年运程更是只有一个旺字可以形容。 
		首先，家家过年都会派红包，这些红包钱可能流向餐饮、服饰等诸多领域，但最后的集散点肯定是银行。 
		随着存款的增加，这将确保联昌集团的净利息赚益和信贷成本趋向稳定，猪年盈利增长可能加快至11%，连带推高平均股本回酬从2018财政年的9.4%（扣除一次性开销）增加至10%。 
		更重要的是，联昌集团当前股价账面值比例（PBV）为1.0693倍，低于2008至2009年全球金融风暴低点的1.2倍，似乎与猪年强劲盈利增长不成正比。在如此诱人的估值下，你难道不会考虑用红包钱来将之下架？ 
		 
		 
		马银行“虎虎生风”的形象深入民心，加上己亥年是属虎者的“合太岁”年份，与太岁关系友好，有较多合作机会，相信马银行在猪年有望持续大发虎威。 
		马银行业务遍及东盟，加上收入增长与支出增长差（Jaws）持续处于正面、融资成本减少可能进一步强化净利息赚益，以及无论经济阴晴都为集团带来显著贡献的保险与伊斯兰保险业务，将可确保集团在猪年安度风风雨雨。 
		更诱人的是，马银行周息率持续高于领域同侪，同时股息再投资计划更有望为投资者带来更高的回酬，并为股价带来支撑，难怪众多大行声声呼唤还未把握的投资者以免错失良机。 
		 
		 
		华人看重内在相通相融的“圆”、“合”与“和”字，无奈合顺狗年却过得不顺，狗年表现平平，但猪年将彻底除旧迎新，将车库内所有旧车清出，把空间腾出迎接丰田Rush、凯瑞（Camry）、Vios和Yaris等新车款入库，为公司载来满满的金元宝。 
		值得注意的是，这4种车款在未改款前就贡献合顺2018财政年总销量的39%，在新车新气象效益下，占集团销售比重可能在猪年扩大至62%。此外，这些新车款是在合顺丰田重新制定马币兑美元后推出市场，料可带来更好赚幅，而一旦美元兑马币走软，将使合顺财库更为大开。 
		目前，合顺本益比估值仅为12倍，远低于狗年和鸡年的15.4倍和22.2倍，与土猪年盈利潜在增长28%利多根本不相配。 
		 
		 
		所谓兴业，就是希望经营的公司能兴旺，欣欣向荣，公司要长期兴旺，确保资金流的充裕是激活运势必不可缺的关键，而这就要银行大开水喉的支持才行。 
		作为国内第四大银行集团的兴业银行，向来乐于扶持企业增长，这可从其狗年财报亮眼中看出。兴业银行2018财政年盈利表现持续超越大市，首9个月净利已达到《彭博社》预期的80%，纵然未来增长可能有所放缓，但市场一致看好集团全年表现将远胜预期。 
		更重要的是，兴业银行近年来积极改革，集团基本面显著转强，不仅油气业曝险度大大减少，资产素质也显著改善，现普通股一级资本比率（CET1）为14.8%，为领域之最，但平均派息率却仅有30%，低于银行业平均的45%，未来有潜能增加派息，而低见0.8倍股价账面值更是令投资吸引力大增。 
		 
		 
		虽然伊斯兰与“猪”关系并不密切，但一点也不影响回教银行猪年“诸”事大吉。回教银行现有融资组合（占总融资比重70%）以家庭客户为主，同时银行也积极扩大个人融资活动来降低净利息赚益下行压力。 
		回教银行2018财政年有望取得8%贷款增长，表现远超领域同侪，同时盈利也将获得强稳的伊斯兰保险业务支撑。值得一提的是，回教银行近期赎回13亿令吉伊斯兰债券计划中的5亿令吉债券反映出管理层有意透过内部资金来清偿伊债。 
		目前，回教银行以1.28倍的5年股价账面值比例（PBV）低位水平进行交易，根本配不上其逾14%的股本回酬和4.4%周息率表现。 
		 
		 
		 
		电讯股在狗年受到太多杂讯干扰，迟迟未能与投资者雷达搭上线，拖累领域狗年表现跌个狗吃屎，其中亚通在狗年大跌28.39%，为表现第二差的电讯股，相信在猪年提升讯号后，有望与投资者重新接轨。 
		亚通狗年大跌28.39%，叫不少分析员心痛不已，大喊“超卖”！“超卖”！他们认为随着亚通管理层将获利和现金创建列为2019财政年首要任务，盈利复苏已成为公司股价重估的催化剂。 
		值得一提的是，自2018年第三季以来亚通各营运臂膀的营业额引擎运转得非常平顺，管理层更成功达成2018财政年资本开销/营运开销节省10亿令吉目标。最重要的是，与固线市场成为监管单位重点整治区不同，流动电讯市场面对的监管压力相对较轻，也有助转嫁猪年盈利潜在下行风险。 
		 
		 
		过新年，家家都会张灯结彩，下个月电费单自然是涨涨涨，国能自然是笑得哈哈哈。这家国内电力龙头猪年好事不断，先有政府允许今年上半年调高电费附加费，后又携手数码网络（DIGI,6947,主板电讯媒体组）、明讯（MAXIS,6012,主板电讯媒体组）和ASTRO公司（ASTRO,6399,主板电讯媒体组）等电讯公司于马六甲野新（Jasin）启动国家光纤化与连接计划（NFCP），粉红泡泡冒得满满满。 
		虽然市场普遍“中和”看待电费附加费调涨效益，也不预见野新NFCP新计划开跑将带来显著盈利贡献，但别忘了电讯业可是块价值不菲的大饼，若野新NFCP计划最后演变成可行的长期商业计划，将有助于国能多元化盈利来源。 
		值得一提的是，国能股价在狗年显著调整，加上光纤计划潜在盈利前景，以及资本开销周期即将达到顶峰，意味着未来股息潜存上升空间，你是不是已经心动了呢？ 
		 
		 
		狗向来都是忠心的表率，随着执政联邦60多年的主人换人，与旧主人关系密切的不少公司自然心情受到影响，表现自然也跟着变差，砂州日光就是其中之一。 
		全国大选后，砂州日光因面对政治风险，让投资者望而却步，拖累股价大挫，但随着泛婆罗洲大道项目重启，加上砂州政府握有90亿令吉发展预算，未来有望释放更多发展计划，市场对建材需求也将与日俱增，砂州日光这位地头虫自然是最大赢家。 
		就算洋灰和建材业务不振，砂州日光靠着联号公司OMS和建筑与道路维修臂膀强劲的表现，仍足以确定将在土猪年录得创纪录的盈利表现，而州际公路特许经营权延长、OMS工厂落实第二期建设，以及综合磷酸盐工厂（持股60%）都是潜在盈利捎来惊喜的“外卡”，你说是否值得期待呢？ 
		 
		 
		如果用猪年的立春八字去判断，猪年大吉的行业当属“火”的行业，其中就包括狗年先盛后衰的油气业。 
		虽然市场对猪年油价前景仍好淡争持，但却有不少分析员唱好戴乐集团前景，主要看上集团中长期专注耕耘储油设施的清晰政策。目前，边佳兰深水终站首期计三期工程足以确保集团未来永续收入。 
		边加兰深水终站第三期工程启动，短期内虽无法为戴乐集团带来显著盈利贡献，将有助集团吸引新炼油和石化设施投资，并崛起成为亚洲储油枢纽，带来的长期永续收入可观，绝对适合希望放长线钓大鱼的投资者胃口。 
		 
		 
		新年到，消费者都会采办年货，主打咖啡产品的PWROOT公司虽然受惠不大，但却被市场看好将在土猪年大“发”。 
		PWROOT公司狗年财报起伏不定，为确保猪年业务发展顺遂，集团已决定多管齐下，在短期内扩大产品种类，同时减少广告与促销开支，以及启动“Alicafe”和“亚发”品牌重塑计划，让集团能在新年以崭新姿态重新出发。 
		更重要的是，随着美元走强和原料成本下跌，加上集团通过与代理商洽商更好的条件、改善库存管理和成本撙节，短期盈利赚益有望转强，未来3年（2019至2021财政年）每股盈利复合年均增长率达到75.3%，加上4.7至6.8%周息率和净现金1940万令吉利多，投资者是否觉得饮得杯落呢？ 
		 
		 
		成也油价，败也油价，世霸动力狗年被起伏不定的国际油价唬弄，股价仅增长6%，未能重演金鸡年翻倍的亮眼成绩。 
		虽然土猪年油价依旧阴晴难测，但世霸动力靠着手头的75亿令吉订单，都足以确保未来3年衣食无忧，更何况集团放眼猪年将订单总量扩大至100亿令吉，未来日子过得悠哉悠滋绝对不是问题。 
		整体来看，世霸动力基本面依旧强稳，猪年招来更多新合约将推动订单总量再创新高，每股盈利有望增长23%，但现有本益比仅为10.9倍，总体估值依然诱人。 
		 
		 
		忠诚，是益纳利美昌狗年犯得最大的错，过于忠于特定产品、特定客户导致业务随着外围因素起伏不定，拖累狗年股价大跌56.14%。 
		不过，益纳利美昌吃过亏自然也怕了，管理层已透露出多元化营业额来源的意愿，其中Mini LED和感应器产品组合等产品于今年3月量产后，有望缓冲射频（RF）晶片业务萎靡冲击。 
		除开拓新产品外，益纳利美昌也积极寻找新客户来降低对单一客户的依赖风险，加上产能扩充计划、强劲赚益，以及良好的资产负债表扶持，未来盈利可能持续以双位数扩张，难怪能打动不少大行的心。 
		 
		 
		过大年，与医院扯上关系绝对是大禁忌。不过，别忘了，土猪年有望带来源源不绝的财源，让全民不仅吃得好，还吃得饱，一个不小心吃得太好了，顾身体的我们自然会去医院走一趟，柔佛医药保健自然有望从中获利。 
		政府在2019年财政预算案提高卫生部拨款7.8%至290亿令吉，并建议成立新低收入群的医疗保障基金计划（B40HPF），让B40族群可享受高达8000令吉的36种重大疾病免费保障、14日每日50令吉的住院收入保障等好处，占全马医疗保健市场23%市占率的柔佛医药保健自然有望从中分一杯羹。 
		在上述利多扶持下，柔佛医药保健前景固然被人看高一线。该公司现本益比仅为20.7倍，较竞争对手IHH医保（IHH,5225,主板医疗保健组）的41.8倍低了50.5%，但1.9%周息率却远高于IHH医保的0.6%。

1023, CIMB GROUP HOLDINGS BHD ," Fri, 25 Jan 2019, 10:12 AM ",PublicInvest Research Headlines - 25 Jan 2019,Economy Markets Market Update," The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits fell to more than a 49-year low last week, but the drop likely overstates the health of the labor market as claims for several states including California were estimated. Still, labor market conditions remain strong, which for now should help to temper fears of a sharp slowdown in economic growth. The economy is facing several headwinds, including a month-long partial shutdown of the federal government, which is starting to hurt both consumer and business confidence. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 199,000 for the week ended Jan. 19, the lowest level since mid-Nov in 1969 when 197,000 applications were recorded, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised lower to show 1,000 fewer applications received than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 220,000 in the latest week. (Reuters)  A measure of US consumer sentiment fell to the lowest in almost seven months and ratings of the economy deteriorated amid the longest government shutdown in the country’s history. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index declined to 57.4 last week from 58.1 as a gauge of views on the buying climate slid to a 10-week low, according to a report Thursday. A measure of Americans’ ratings of their personal finances edged up. While comfort remains elevated after rising to a 17- year high in late Sept, the measure has been giving up gains as the impasse in Washington idles federal workers. With no sign of a conclusion soon for the shutdown, evidence is mounting that the closure will take a bigger toll on the economy. (Bloomberg)  The US and China are “miles and miles” from resolving trade issues but there is a fair chance the two countries will get a deal, US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Thursday. A 30-member Chinese delegation plans to come to Washington next week for a round of trade talks next week, he said, as the world’s two largest economies try to meet a March 1 deadline to resolve their trade disputes. Ross tried to tamp down expectations for the high-level talks. “There is a very large group coming. There’s been a lot of anticipatory work done but we’re miles and miles from getting a resolution and frankly that shouldn’t be too surprising,” Ross said. (Reuters)  The ECB left its key interest rates and forward guidance unchanged on Thursday, in the first policy session since the end of its four-year long EUR2.6trn asset purchase programme in Dec. The Governing Council, led by Mario Draghi, left the key interest rates unchanged after the policy session in Frankfurt. The main refi rate is currently at a record low zero percent and the deposit rate at -0.4%. The marginal lending facility rate is at 0.25%. Eurozone interest rates were raised last in July 2011 by 25 basis points. ""The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term,"" the bank said. (RTT)  ECB President Mario Draghi acknowledged on Thursday that risks to euro zone growth had shifted to the downside due to possible fall-out from factors ranging from China’s slowdown to Brexit. The region’s economy is already suffering its biggest slowdown in half a decade, raising questions over whether the ECB will be able to increase interest rates for the first time in a decade later this year as its current guidance indicates. It left that guidance and interest rates unchanged at its meeting on Thursday but Draghi’s comment will fuel market speculation that the bank will end up delaying a tightening in policy or even move to cut borrowing costs. “The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook have moved to the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties,” Draghi said. “The near-term growth momentum is likely to be weaker than previously expected.” (Reuters)  The People’s Bank of China said it is setting up a new facility to encourage banks to replenish capital by issuing perpetual bonds, in a further move aimed at securing financing for the flagging economy. The new tool, called Central Bank Bills Swap, works by giving primary dealers bills that can be used as high-quality collateral in exchange for perpetual bonds purchased from banks. The step coincides with the planned issuance on Friday of the first such instrument by a Chinese lender. The PBOC also announced it’ll include perpetual bonds sold by banks with a rating equal or higher than AA as eligible collateral for monetary policy operations, Medium-term Lending Facility, targeted MLF and Standing Lending Facility. (Bloomberg)  Inflation in Tokyo showed unexpected strength in Jan as higher electricity bills nudged up prices. Consumer prices excluding fresh food in Tokyo, a leading indicator for nationwide inflation figures, rose 1.1% from a year earlier, according to the ministry of internal affairs. That’s stronger than the median estimate of 0.9% from economists and the highest reading since figures were distorted by a sales-tax increase in 2014. The latest figures come just two days after the BOJ sharply lower cedits price forecast for the year starting April. With inflation far from BOJ’s target, most analysts predict no change in Japan’s monetary policy this year. (Bloomberg)  CIMB Group Holdings said it plans to enter into the investment banking market in the Philippines, after its wholly-owned unit CIMB Group SB received the relevant approvals from the Securities and Exchange Commission of the Philippines to establish its investment banking business there. CIMB's unit will be operating its investment banking business in the Philippines via a 60% shareholding in CIMB Bancom Capital Corp; the remaining 40% stake in CIMB Bancom will be held by local partners — Bancom II Consultants Inc and PLP Group Holdings Inc. (The Edge) Comments: This is a positive development considering the healthy economic growth Philippines is seeing, essentially also cascading into capital market activities. With investment banking presence in 10 countries, amongst which include Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore, the expansion bodes well with ample room cross-border opportunities and/or collaborations. This also comes on the heels of the Group recently establishing its retail banking presence in the country late last year. We continue to like CIMB Group's long term growth prospects and affirm our Outperform call.  The High Court here has granted Genting Malaysia (GENM) leave to commence judicial review proceedings against the ministry of finance's (MoF) decision to amend the 2014 tax incentive approval in Dec 2017. (The Edge) Comments : In Dec 2014, the MoF had granted tax incentive for the Genting Integrated Tourism Plan (GITP), which entitled GENM to claim for income tax exemption for qualified capital expenditure that it incurred for a period of 10 years. However, the MoF decided in 2017 to amend the approval given which effectively prolongs the utilisation period of the tax allowances “significantly”. Should GENM fail and the amended tax incentive prevails, GENM’s tax cost would increase and this could post further earnings risk to the group already saddled with several outstanding litigations. We expect this to be a drag to its share price and reiterate our Underperform call on GENM.  Muhibbah Engineering (M) has bagged 2 contracts worth RM165m to supply noise barriers for installation along the Sungai Besi-Ulu Kelang Elevated Expressway (SUKE) and the Damansara Shah Alam Elevated Expressway (DASH). It has accepted the award of the contracts from Permodalan Nasional Bhd's (PNB) for a combined RM165m. Turnpike Synergy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Projek Lintasan Kota Holdings SB, which in turn is wholly-owned by PNB. (The Edge)  Tycoon Tan Sri Danny Tan Chee Sing, founder and major shareholder of Tropicana Corp with a 63.56% stake, is back at the helm of the property developer as executive vice chairman after a three-and-a-half-year hiatus. The appointments come as Chee Sing injects into the group, what is left of his privately owned land bank worth RM1.85bn, representing a 17.9% discount as compared to the indicative market value. The land bank amounting to 1,116.88 acres under 12 real estate holding companies are located in the Klang Valley and Johor, with the potential GDV of RM24.82bn. (The Edge)  MyEG Services will appeal against the daily penalty of RM7,500 imposed on it by the Malaysia Competition Commission (MyCC) for abusing its market position in the provision and management of online foreign workers’ permit renewal. It said it would file an appeal to the Court of Appeal after the KL High Court upheld MyCC’s decision under Section 10(2)(d)(iii) of the Competition Act 2010 for abusing its dominant position. (StarBiz)  TMC Life Sciences net profit rose 11.7% to RM7.07m for 1QFY19) from RM6.34m a year ago, on higher patient load, higher intensity cases handled and additional consultants recruited. This resulted in a higher EPS of 0.41sen compared with 0.36sen in 1QFY18. Quarterly revenue also grew 13% to RM47.16m from RM41.73m a year ago. On prospects, it will continue to adopt measures to maintain growth by introducing more services, while ramping up outreach and marketing efforts. (The Edge)  Syarikat Takaful Malaysia Keluarga net profit shot up 61% to RM90.57m in its 4QFY18 from RM56.3m a year ago, thanks to higher gross contributions from its family and general takaful businesses. EPS almost doubled to 10.99sen versus 5.55sen in 4QFY17, while revenue rose 35% to RM701.51m from RM517.74m. For the full year, the group’s net profit rose 43% to a record high of RM294.92m compared with RM206.7m a year ago. (The Edge)  Caring Pharmacy Group announced a 34.3% YoY surge in net profit for the 2QFY19, on the back of higher margins and commendable sales at its new and existing outlets. Net profit was higher at RM5.74m or EPS of 2.64sen, against RM4.26m or 1.96sen a year ago. Revenue grew 12.8% to RM139.30m, from RM123.45m in 2QFY18, contributed by sales generated from its 10 new outlets, as well as higher sales from its existing pharmacies. (The Edge)  The International Trade and Industry Ministry (Miti) might be looking towards a reduction in excise duties for vehicles, which will, in turn, result in a reduction in car prices. While there may be less revenue for the government from a reduction in excise duties, this can be compensated by a larger sales volume. (StarBiz) Comments: Excise duty on motor vehicles currently stands at about 60% to 105%, and is levied on all products, whether imported or manufactured locally. However, some incentives are given to local manufactured parts as well as electric vehicles. We believe the news from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) to reduce the excise duties is good for the automotive industry and may help to spur demand. While this is still under preliminary stages, we are positive on the news as this may allow auto players to lower vehicle prices, which augurs well for sales growth. The FBM KLCI might end the week with negative note as global stock markets struggled to establish a clear direction as uncertainty over the outlook for US-China trade talks was offset by strong gains for chipmakers following some encouraging trading updates from the sector. Shares in European semiconductor group STMicroelectronics jumped more than 10 percent after its results proved better than expected. Wall Street then picked up the baton, with the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index hitting its highest level since the start of December, following some upside earnings surprises from the likes of Xilinx and Lam Research after Wednesday’s closing bell but the optimism was tempered by comments from Wilbur Ross, US commerce secretary, that Washington was “miles and miles” from resolving trade issues with Beijing — although he later clarified that there was “a fair chance” a deal would be reached. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 ended 0.1% higher at 2,636 — after earlier hitting 2,647 — while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.7%. Across the Atlantic, the Stoxx 600 Europe index ended 0.2% higher. Meanwhile, the Xetra Dax in Frankfurt rose 0.5% but London’s FTSE 100 finished 0.4% lower. Back home, the FBM KLCI index gained 5.45 points or 0.32% to 1,693.59 points on Thursday. Trading volume increased to 2.44bn worth RM2.12bn. Market breadth was positive with 458 gainers as compared to 375 losers. In China, the CSI 300 index of major Shanghai and Shenzhen stocks gained 0.6% after China approved a new technology-focused index in Shanghai. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong rose 0.4%, as did the Topix index in Tokyo. Source:   - 25 Jan 2019"

Below are some of the key take away from our meeting:  Without divulging in details, we understand that the income weakness we have observed up to 9MFY18 will persist in 4QFY18. These are mainly coming from weak NII and NOII in Indonesia and Malaysia respectively. Recall, 9MFY18 NII and NOII declined -3.7%yoy and -10.0%yoy respectively. While these weaknesses will be moderated by contained OPEX and lower provisions, we understand that it will not fully offset the income gap.  Nevertheless, we expect that income in FY19 will improve premise on: i) Less pressure in NIM in Indonesia due to repricing of assets following from the policy rate hike in CY18. ii) NIM stability in Malaysia as deposits competition remains rational. iii) Loans growth expected to remain stable.

We understand from management that FY18E loans target growth of 6% is achievable driven by resilient retail spending and supported by pickup in corporate loans in 4Q18. Moving forward into FY19, management guided that its pipeline for corporate loans will be decent and sustainable into 1H19. We find its 6% loans growth target for FY19 to be challenging given that it is expected to be retail driven while corporate loans are likely to taper in 2H18 in line with the expected slowdown. FY19E loan mix will likely be different from 2018 as Malaysia’s loans growth will be moderating (unlikely to be in high single-digit) while loan book is expected to be driven by improved performance from Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore. Management expects Niaga’s 2019 loans to be driven by retail spending and expects the acceleration in loans to occur mainly in 2H19. Moderation in 2019 Malaysia’s loans growth will likely be from weaknesses in the property market, but management expects mortgages to maintain above industry growth. . Margin compression is expected to be as guided (5-10bps) for FY18, with compression coming mainly from Indonesia due to the spate of rate hikes in 2018 but likely to face ~5% NIM as guided previously. Going forward, 2019 NIM is guided for a 5- 10bps compression, with pressure coming from Malaysian as new mortgage loans are coming in (new loans with lower rates). Downside pressure from Indonesia is likely to persist as we do not expect rate hikes coming in 2019 with funding pressure likely to creep up as credit demand grows in 2019. Indonesian NIM is expected to be <5% for 2019. Management highlighted satisfactory asset quality across the board; thus, credit charge for FY18E revised from the low 50s bps to even <50bps. Indications from management are for better asset quality for the Group for 2019 with guidance of 40-50bps credit cost for ahead. Uptick in CIMB Thai’s credit cost seen recently will have no bearing for the Group’s as it had made provisions as per IFRS9 requirements at the Group level. Going forward, we estimate CIMB Thai’s credit costs (for FY19) to range at 200-230bps as we expect additional provisioning as a pre-emptive measure for FRS9 in 2020. For Indonesia, credit costs will likely range at 150-200bps as interest rates are expected to be stable going into 2019. No change to our FY18E/FY19E earnings of RM4.8b/RM4.8b based on our conservative unchanged assumptions; (i) loans growth of ~5.5%/5.2%, (ii) NIM at -10bps/-5bps, and (iii) credit costs of 50/51 bps. . Our Target Price is maintained at RM6.05 based on an unchanged PB/PE of 1.0x/12.0x with the PB at 0.5SD below its 5-year mean to reflect the on-going challenges ahead namely: (i) moderating loans, (ii) downside pressure on NIMs, and (iii) soft capital market activities.

Despite overnight 171-pt technical rebound, the Dow continued to trend below the critical 200D SMA levels near 24972. The MACD histogram is moderating and the Stochastic oscillator is hovering in overbought zones while RSI remains neutral. Hence, we believe the recent V shape rebound will be taking a pause and could retrace back below the 24000 psychological level if the immediate support near 23968 (14d SMA) is violated decisively. As the unabating lists of headwinds permeate, the Dow is expected to trap in range bound consolidation in view of the ongoing reporting season and partial US government shutdown coupled with the continuing US-China trade deal talks before the March deadline. Besides, IMF’s move to cuts its global forecast and growing frustrations by CEOs gathered at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Trump policies amid fears that unresolved trade war with China will dampen the global economy and business investments even further.

Meanwhile, 4Q18 NIM is expected to remain under pressure arising from weaknesses in Indonesia. We see a modest outlook for CIMB Group in 2019E (core net profit growth +2.2% yoy; core EPS -1.1% yoy), consistent with our macro view that confidence and business expectation remain cautious. Overall, the Malaysian operations will remain the key earnings driver for the Group in 2019, but we do not discount the likelihood of rate hikes by the Bank of Indonesia, of which is a dampener to CIMB Niaga’s shortterm NIM. Maintain  ,  at  (1.14x CY19E P/BV). We are projecting a 4Q18 net profit of circa RM1.1bn for CIMB, and a FY18 normalized net profit of circa RM4.6bn, which is likely to fall within Affin’s and consensus estimates. CIMB Group is expected to see a shortfall in both 4Q18 and 2018 net interest and non-interest income. CIMB Niaga will likely see a NIM compression in 4Q18 (from 5.17% in 3Q18) arising from the rate hike in Nov18, with 2018’s NIM estimated to be circa 50-60bps lower yoy to 5.1%- 5.0%. Non-interst income will also likely see a decline (yoy and qoq) in 4Q18, largely due to poor performance of the treasury and markets division in Malaysia. To recap, the Group also saw weaker non-interest income in 2Q18, due to the heavy selldown of the Malaysian market after GE14. Though there were some drawdown for corporate loans in Malaysia in 4Q18 (mostly working capital lines), we understand from management that these were more likely pent-up demand in 2018 and is not an indicator of a broad-based capacity expansion in 2019. The Group, which saw fairly robust growth in Malaysia’s residential mortgages in 2018, may potentially see growth momentum tapering off in 2019. According to management, the Group is likely to meet its 2018 loan growth KPI of 6% as the Malaysian loanbook continued to outgrow the industry. For year-to-date 9M18, Malaysia’s loan growth (yoy) stood at 7.6%, Indonesia at -1.3%, Singapore at 14.5%, while Thailand (FY18) at 5.2%. As deposit rates reprice ahead of financing rates in Indonesia, CIMB Niaga suffered from a severe NIM compression throughout 9M18, amounting to - 62bps from 5.74% (9M17) to 5.12% (9M18) subsequent to six rate hikes totalling 175bps. A potential slowdown in the Indonesia’s rate hikes in 2019 will augur well for CIMB Niaga’s net interest income as it will gradually see the positive repricing impact of its loanbook. Nonetheless, the Indonesia Central Bank had reasserted that it would act to defend its exchange rate when needed through tightening initiatives in 2019. Maintain HOLD with Price Target of RM6.10, based on a 1.14x P/BV target on CY19E BVPS (based on 2019E 9.3% ROE and 8.8% cost of equity). No revisions in our CIMB Group forecasts. For now, our 2019E key assumptions include loan growth at 4.2% yoy, NIM at 2.45%, credit cost at 53bps and CIR of 51%.

Top-line was soft due to falling NOII (-8.1% YoY) but mitigated by improvement in NII (+5.3% YoY). Improvement in NII was supported by higher loans (+7.6% YoY vs. 12M17: +3.1% YoY) but mitigated by falling NIMs (- 64bps to 4.1%) due to competitive lending rates. Credit charge improved by 14bps to 2.2% in tandem with improvement in asset quality with GIL down by 20bps to 4.3%. CNP registered a net loss of THB530m dragged by higher opex (+8.5%) and impairment allowances (+70.6%) despite top-line improving by 4.1% to THB3.31b. Historically, in the last 3 years, CNP had been in the negative territory due to higher opex in the fourth quarter. Loans moderated at +3.1% but historically loans were also soft in Q4. Asset quality improved as GIL fell 140bps to 4.3% but credit charge saw a 120bps surge to 2.9% due to guidelines from BOT in preparation of IFRS9 in 2020. , for FY19E, we expect uptick in credit charge due to the new guidelines from the BOT. Loans will likely moderate driven by consumer demand (as interest rates are still accommodative despite the 25bps hike to 1.75% in Dec 2018) as we expect exports to moderate. We also expect downside pressure on NIM due to competitive lending ahead. However, we expect improved FY19E earnings ahead at THB390m based on these assumptions; (i) loans growth of <6%, (ii) NIM at <4.0%, (iii) credit costs at 250bps, (iv) CIR at 57%, and (v) tax rate at <22%. for the Group, as historically CIMB Thai’s contribution to the Group is minimal (at <5%). FY17 PBT contribution was at 3% and we expect contribution for FY18 to be <2%. For now, pending the Group’s 12M18 results expected at the end of next month, our forecast earnings are maintained for now. We have previously revised FY18E earning by 4% to RM4.8b based on assumptions as follow: (i) loans growth of ~5.5%, (ii) NIM compression at 10bps, and (iii) credit charge of 50bps. based on an unchanged PB/PE of 1.0x/12.0x with the PB 0.5SD-level below its 5-year mean to reflect the on-going challenges ahead for the Group; challenging loans, uptick in credit charge and downside pressure on NIMs. Reiterate as we feel our FY18E earnings are fair and conservative enough, justifying our TP, giving a potential return of >10%. (i) higher-than-expected margin squeeze, (ii) lower-than-expected loans and deposits growth, (iii) worse-than-expected deterioration in asset quality, (iv) further slowdown in capital market activities, and (v) adverse currency fluctuations.

With no fundamental change expected and lacking any concrete catalysts, we are inclined to maintain a Neutral stance for the sector. The global and domestic uncertainties are causing concerns of moderate loans growth and soft capital market activities ahead. So far, banks in our universe have been supported by lower impairment allowances and likely to remain so due to normalization of credit charge ahead. Our NEUTRAL stance is kept unchanged as potential total return in our banking universe is still <7%. However, we have  call for most of the banks under our coverage, i.e. AFFIN (TP: RM2.60), ABMB (TP: RM4.40) BIMB (TP: RM5.05), CIMB (TP: RM6.05), MAYBANK (TP: RM9.75), MBSB (TP: RM1.25) and RHBBANK (TP: RM5.75). The remainders are rated as MARKET PERFORM. Our Top Picks are BIMB and MBSB, both benefiting from undemanding valuations – at the bottom of their respective PBV 5-year mean.  the KL Finance Index (KLFIN) YTD, still outperformed the FMBKLCI by 8.5ppt in 2018. Driving the KLFIN were the sharp performances of PBBANK (+19%) and HLBANK (+20%) while the other two heavyweights, i.e. CIMB and MAYBANK, slumped 13% and 3%, respectively. PBBANK and HLBANK have the added advantage of stable and consistent asset quality with Gross Impaired loans (GIL) and credit costs the best performing in the industry. For RHBBANK, receding concerns of its O&G portfolio (with unexpected recovery in impairments) with better-thanexpected NIMs pushed it into 3rd place. For CIMB and MAYBANK, concerns on asset quality from the external front saw both slumping into the negative territory. BIMB was the worst performer for 2019, largely due to concerns of its Sukuk liabilities should a restructuring occur.  There are asset-based methods of valuation (price to book value ratio or PBV) and earningsbased (PER or ROE) methods of valuation. Here, we blend PBV/ROE valuations, which incorporate both earnings and asset factors into a single ‘metric’. According to the Financial Analyst Journal Vol. 40 1984, investors combine Price/Book (PBV) ratio and return on equity (ROE) to factor in both earnings and net assets of a business when trying to make comparison between valuations of different businesses. This PBV/ROE analysis is also known as the combined asset-earnings valuation framework.  which is often regarded as a proxy of liquidation value. Consequently, a common characteristic of low PBV companies is that they are either loss-making or have very poor profitability and this can be very unappealing for certain investors. This is where Return on Equity (ROE) comes in. ROE measures the level of profitability based on the amount of net assets owned by a company. By incorporating ROE, PBV/ROE measures how cheap the assets of the company are in relation to their level of profitability.Figure 3 shows, the industry volatilities and trends signified by its average industry PBV/ROE. In shape 1 (S1), the market was bullish on the banking industry with PBV/ROE ascending steeply targeting a ~12x PBV/ROE. Figure 4 shows all the banking stocks in our universe following this trend. During the period S2, the market was bearish as signified in figure 3 descending to a <11x ratio as most banking stocks were in a downtrend. Mitigating the trend was HLBANK, MAYBANK and PBBANK boosted by in its improving impairment allowances. S3 saw another bearish momentum similar to S2 post GE14 as markets perceived weak business environment due to internal/external headwinds and the market priced a similar low PBV/ROE as S2.

1023, CIMB GROUP HOLDINGS BHD ," Wed, 2 Jan 2019, 10:14 AM ",Top 10 Stock Picks for 1H 2019 by The Edge Daily,,"
													AFTER a brutal 2018 in which equity markets took a turn for the worse, market watchers turned more cautious with their outlook 
													for the first half of 2019. Dark clouds of uncertainty continued to loom over earnings prospects and global investor interest. 
													The Edge Financial Daily picked its portfolio based on various themes, including several stocks that have been battered down and now command more attractive valuations. While economic conditions are seen to potentially worsen next year, growth driven by domestic private consumption is another factor that could support corporate earnings. Malaysia has also been highlighted as an early beneficiary of the US-China trade war, such as its technology and manufacturing sectors, if trade talks do not deteriorate. 
													  
													 
													At a price-earnings ratio (PER) of 3.48 times, AirAsia Group Bhd is currently one of the cheapest stocks on Bursa Malaysia. After having touched a record RM4.60 in early February, it fell steadily to as low as RM2.38 in late October. The stock closed 2018 unchanged at RM2.97 on Monday. 
													Rising fuel prices, which sent AirAsia’s core net profit for the nine months ended Sept 30, 2018 (9MFY18) tumbling some 33% to RM805.08 million, may have been one of the reasons investors avoided it last year. In fact, CIMB Research downgraded the stock to “sell” after it posted a disappointing set of results for 9MFY18. A weaker ringgit against the US dollar compounded the low-cost carrier’s woes. 
													That being said, shareholders enjoyed a bumper dividend of 40 sen per share from AirAsia after the third quarter due to the group’s disposal of its stake in online travel agency Expedia and its leasing unit, Asia Aviation Capital Ltd. The carrier is expected to continue paying dividends as over 60 sen per share were initially estimated to be disbursed from the billion-dollar disposal. 
													On top of that, the price of Brent crude oil has been on a downward trend since October 2018, to below US$60 (RM247.80) per barrel in mid-December. 
													“We believe that jet fuel prices will follow suit, and AirAsia and AirAsia X Bhd will be able to take advantage by hedging more on the declining trend of oil price[s]. As such, we expect these two airlines will be able to reap the benefit in 2019,” MIDF Research said in its 2019 strategy report dated Dec 17, 2018. 
													MIDF Research is one of the 14 out of 20 analysts covering the stock that is bullish on AirAsia’s prospects, according to Bloomberg data. 
													“[Despite the unfavourable fuel price environment], AirAsia’s short-haul business model proved to be defensive with [its] earnings before interest and tax margin standing close to 20% during the period,” the research house said. 
													On top of that, MIDF Research does not expect the new departure levy effective June this year to be a strong dampener on travellers, but to encourage more travel within Malaysia instead. 
													“Sensitivity towards increases in passenger service charges for international destinations has always been historically minimal,” the research house said. 
													Also, AirAsia has planned to expand capacity by adding 10 fuel-saving aircraft to its fleet in financial year 2019 (FY19) on top of a planned increase in international routes. 
													The group’s recent RM3.22 billion sale and leaseback of 25 aircraft to US-based private investment firm Castlelake LP was also viewed as a positive development. 
													“The proposed disposal concurs well with AirAsia’s digitalisation efforts,” MIDF Research said in a Dec 26 report, highlighting that this will raise the group’s cash pile and result in annual savings, which will help partially offset rental expenses. 
													  
													 
													FGV Holdings Bhd seems to be an unlikely choice for a stock pick, given the bout of bad news surrounding the global agri-business giant last year. 
													But TA Securities chief investment officer Choo Swee Kee opined that FGV had suffered enough in the past year and is now on the path of redemption. 
													“It has gone through weak management, poor risk control, declining crude palm oil (CPO) prices, bad acquisition [decisions] and recently a substantial write-off to the tune of almost RM800 million. 
													“With FGV being government-linked, new management and better policies have been put forward to turn the company around. It is critical the government gets it right this time as this may have implications for thousands of Felda settlers. Investors’ expectations are low and any sign of improvement will be taken as positive,” he told The Edge Financial Daily. 
													For the nine-month financial period ended Sept 30, 2018 (9MFY18), FGV reported a net loss of RM871.15 million, compared to a net profit of RM80.49 million a year ago, largely due to impairment losses of RM798 million. The bulk of the impairment stemmed from goodwill on the acquisition of Asian Plantations Ltd. 
													Year-to-date, CPO prices, which play a significant role in FGV’s plantation business, had declined by 21% to RM1,903 per tonne on Dec 26, 2018. 
													Choo noted a reprieve for FGV’s current depressed share price as the value of its assets and land. 
													“FGV is trading at a [more than] 30% discount to its net tangible assets. It owns about 350,000 hectares of plantation land,” he said. 
													Choo views FGV as a recovery play, and has a “buy” call on the stock, with a target price (TP) of RM1 per share. 
													FGV shares lost 60% or RM3.96 billion of its market value in the past year. It closed at 71.5 sen on Monday, with a market capitalisation of RM2.61 billion. 
													  
													 
													Last year, Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd was one of only two gainers in The Edge Financial Daily’s portfolio of top picks. The oil and gas solution’s provider remained a bright spot on Bursa despite volatility in both the equity market and oil prices in 2018. 
													The group’s share price has maintained its upward climb since its listing on Bursa in February 2017 at RM1.53. As at Dec 31, 2018, the counter had closed at RM3.78, up 17.4% over the past year and more than double its listing price. 
													That being said, analysts are still upbeat on Serba Dinamik’s prospects. Ten Bloomberg analysts with an eye on the stock, all recommended Serba Dinamik as a “buy”, with an average 12-month TP of RM4.91. 
													“Prospects to grow its engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning segment remain promising, with ample hydropower and utilities projects up for grabs,” said Affin Hwang Capital in a report on Dec 26, 2018. 
													The group’s earnings growth is expected to be driven by its Terengganu water treatment plant as well as its overseas ventures, the research firm said. These include a 30-megawatt power plant in Laos, a contract with New Thunder Technical Services in the United Arab Emirates and a chlor-alkali plant the group is building in Tanzania via a joint venture. 
													On Dec 10, 2018, Serba Dinamik said it targets to achieve an order book of RM10 billion by end-2019. On top of that, a more bullish outlook for Petroliam Nasional Bhd’s 2019-2021 downstream plant turnaround activities could potentially boost the group’s contributions from Malaysia, said Affin Hwang Capital. 
													Serba Dinamik recorded a 21.4% increase in net profit to RM278.61 million for 9MFY18 on the back of strong growth in its operation and maintenance activities. Revenue was up 20% year-on-year at RM2.31 billion for 9MFY18. 
													  
													 
													Kelington Group Bhd serves industries requiring ultra-high-purity gases and chemicals in specialised applications. 
													TA Securities’ Choo said the barrier to entry is rather high in industries where Kelington serves as the provider, so one would need to have a good safety track record and trust among clients. 
													“We like Kelington as it has a proven business with multinational clients. The group’s financial year ending Dec 31, 2020 earnings growth will come from its new [liquid] carbon dioxide plant [in Kerteh, Terengganu], with a capacity of 50,000 tonnes. [The] break-even capacity is estimated at 30% and the company already has unofficial take-up of 30% to 40% for its capacity. 
													“Conservatively, we target [for Kelington’s] share price to grow 25%, mirroring its earnings growth,” he told The Edge Financial Daily. 
													The group also has a growing clientele in China, having clinched several contracts for ultra-high-purity gas works from global seminconductor giants there. 
													“Made in China 2025 is a key initiative to significantly increase [the] manufacturing capacity of memory chips and integrated circuits. This initiative has become even more urgent to China given the current trade war with the US. 
													“Therefore, we believe Kelington is set to benefit from this massive build-up of capacity regardless of [the] global outlook,” Choo said. 
													In a Nov 23, 2018 note on Kelington, RHB Research analyst Jeffrey Tan concurred that the new Kerteh plant’s commencement, slated for the third quarter of 2019, should provide the group with an additional RM5 million revenue uplift in 2019 and RM20 million in 2020. 
													“Management expects its industrial gas business to generate about RM1 billion in revenue over the plant’s lifespan of 15 to 20 years, which could translate into a revenue of RM50 million per year beginning 2024,” said Tan. 
													Tan has a “buy” call on Kelington, with a TP of RM1.41, a 20.6% upside to Kelington’s share price at RM1.12 on Monday, with a market capitalisation of RM298.18 million. 
													  
													 
													Although Bermaz Auto Bhd (BAuto), the distributor of Mazda cars in Malaysia, enjoyed record-breaking earnings for the first half of financial year ending April 30, 2019 (1HFY19), the group’s share price has lagged behind. 
													Its share price has slipped three sen or 1.4% in the past year to RM2.15 on Monday. 
													This may have been because following a boom in sales during the tax holiday between June and September 2018, leading to a tripling of net profit to RM124.2 million for 1HFY19, BAuto recorded a dip — reflecting the implementation of the sales and service tax on Sept 1. 
													The car distributor has forecast continued challenges for FY19, citing a competitive trading environment, a weak ringgit and cautious consumer sentiments on the back of economic uncertainty. 
													Despite this, BAuto said the bookings it had since collected were “encouraging” ahead of the year-end festive season. 
													Its planned launches of the new Mazda CX-8 and Mazda 3 in the mid- to second half of 2019 are also expected to support the group’s strong earnings growth trajectory. 
													“The story of BAuto’s growth is not over yet. The introduction of the [new models] would sustain growth in Malaysia and reinvigorate sales in the Philippine operations,” Maybank Kim Eng noted in a Dec 12 report. 
													The stock is also considered an attractive dividend play. For 1HFY19, the group announced a total dividend of 6.25 sen per share, doubling from 3.1 sen a year ago. 
													In 2018, BAuto was among the better performing stocks on Bursa in terms of dividend yields, with a rolling 12-month dividend yield of 6.3% as at Dec 31, 2018. 
													“BAuto is undervalued for its growth and dividend potentials,” Maybank Kim Eng said in its report. 
													Bloomberg data show all 14 analysts covering the stock are recommending a “buy”, with a consensus 12-month TP of RM2.68. 
													That being said, a potential source of volatility is the exchange rate of the ringgit against the yen, as almost 35% of BAuto’s cost of goods sold is denominated in yen, Maybank Kim Eng noted. 
													  
													 
													Frontken Corp Bhd provides surface engineering services for the oil and gas (O&G), petrochemical, power generation, semiconductor and electronic manufacturing sectors. 
													The stock was a top pick among technology sector stocks by Hong Leong Investment Bank analyst Tan J Young in his Dec 19, 2018 report on the technology sector outlook for 2019. 
													“Frontken remains our top pick on the back of a bullish global semiconductor market outlook, a robust fabrication investment, leading-edge technology, a recovery in the O&G sector and a strong balance sheet,” said Tan. 
													Tan has a “buy” call on Frontken, with a TP of RM1.05. Frontken shares had appreciated 46.9% over the past year to 70.5 sen on Monday. 
													For the nine months ended Sept 30, 2018 (9MFY18), Frontken reported a 67.6% y-o-y increase in net profit to RM33.57 million, thanks to an improved performance of its subsidiaries in Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines. Revenue for the period was up 10.3% to RM238.5 million from RM216.2 million for 9MFY17. 
													As of Sept 30, 2018, Frontken had a cash balance of RM119.55 million and total borrowings of RM12.83 million. 
													  
													 
													Like most construction-related counters, shares in Kerjaya Prospek Group Bhd have floundered following the May 9 general election amid rising uncertainty over projects on the local construction scene. 
													The group, however, has not been deterred from aiming high. It targets to build up a RM1.2 billion order book for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2019 (FY19), which is 20% more than its RM1 billion target for FY18. As at Nov 28, 2018, its tender book had stood at RM1.5 billion. 
													Kerjaya has already gotten a good head start for its goal, most recently bagging a RM211.6 million contract from tycoon Tan Sri Robert Kuok Hock Nien-controlled PPB Group Bhd to construct a mixed development project in Petaling Jaya. 
													“We believe that Kerjaya is the least affected contractor in town due to its zero exposure to government-related jobs as all of their construction jobs are from the private sector,” said Kenanga Research in a Dec 6 note. 
													“In the near term, we are still anticipating another replenishment worth about RM400 million from [executive chairman and major shareholder] Datuk Tee Eng Ho’s private property arm as they are looking to launch a mixed development on Old Klang Road (Kuala Lumpur) with a gross development value of RM1 billion,” it said. 
													Further down the road, the group stands a good chance of winning more contracts in Penang, as more bridges may be required to connect the island to Eastern & Oriental Bhd’s Seri Tanjung Pinang 2 project. 
													Shares in Kerjaya had fallen 37% over the past year to close at RM1.15 on Monday. 
													  
													 
													“If [foreign] funds flow back into the market, [they] will most likely go for the big-capitalisation stocks first,” said Rakuten Trade head of research Kenny Yee, and in such a scenario, he favours banking counter CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. 
													Yee noted that CIMB was one of the component stocks of the KLCI that was badly thrashed in 2018, adding that “the downside is pretty limited.” However, he believes it is one of the stocks that should outperform the benchmark index should foreign investors return this year. 
													Even after an uptick over the last few trading days of 2018, CIMB was still trading at 9.59 times its earnings, below the one standard deviation of its historical 10.5 times PER. 
													Its price-to-book value of 1.0693 times is also comparable to a low of 1.2 times during the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, Maybank Kim Eng pointed out. 
													Rakuten Trade’s research team opined that the banking sector as a whole is expected to drive growth among KLCI constituent stocks next year. 
													Potential risks to CIMB’s share price include shareholding changes, especially as Khazanah Nasional Bhd, which holds the largest stake of 26.8% in the banking group, is expected to be unlocking value of some of its assets next year. However, there could be a potential upside to the stock given that Khazanah will not be disposing of its stakes at “fire-sale prices”, Maybank Kim Eng noted. 
													Meanwhile, Yee does not believe potential changes at the helm of CIMB would have much impact on the day-to-day business of the group. 
													Other positives for CIMB include the outlook for its Indonesian operations amid falling credit costs and a potential repricing of loans after recent rate cuts, noted Maybank Kim Eng in its 2019 strategy report. 
													  
													 
													Despite uncertainty over crude oil prices, floating, production, storage and offloading (FPSO) service provider Yinson Holdings Bhd is still a top pick for analysts. 
													Maybank Investment Bank Research analyst Liaw Thong Jung said in a 2019 outlook note on the O&G sector that Yinson is entrenched to leverage on the booming FPSO market. 
													“[The] global tender pipeline is strong with minimal competition. Securing one job win in 2019 is a near certainty, a catalyst [for Yinson],”he said. 
													Yinson is also a top stock pick for UOB Kay Hian, due to its competitiveness in the international FPSO space. 
													“We like Yinson for its execution track record, and as it is delivering the FPSO Helang contract for the Layang field [offshore Miri, Sarawak] in two years’ time,” the research firm said. 
													Nine out of 10 analysts covering Yinson have a “buy” call on the stock, with a consensus TP of RM5.12. Yinson shares have appreciated by 5% over the past year to close at RM4.20 on Monday. 
													For the cumulative nine months ended Oct 31, 2018 (9MFY19), Yinson reported a 24.5% decline in net profit to RM177.5 million from RM235.04 million a year ago, mainly due to a higher property, plant and equipment impairment loss. Revenue for 9MFY19 grew by 14.5% y-o-y to RM747.3 million due to bareboat chartering contributions from FPSO John Agyekum Kufuor. 
													  
													 
													ACE Market-listed QES Group Bhd is principally involved in the distribution of inspection, test and measurement equipment to the electrical and electronics and automotive industry, as well as materials and engineering solutions to the semiconductor industry. 
													TA Securities’ Choo noted that QES is moving into the manufacturing of optical inspection systems, which is a fast-growing business. 
													“As the sales of these machines improve in 2019, the group’s profit margin should improve accordingly with the economies of scale. QES’ outstanding order book has been growing progressively to more than RM60 million versus the average annual turnover of RM150 million,” he told The Edge Financial Daily. 
													QES was listed on Bursa on March 8, with an initial public offering price of 19 sen per share. Since its listing, its share price had risen 13% to close at 21.5 sen on Monday. 
													“The group can withstand significant stress in the market with a cash horde of RM40 million, which accounts for 23% of its current market capitalisation. A [transfer to the] Main Market will be forthcoming in time [for QES] and then valuations will trade in line with other Main Market technology stocks,” said Choo. 
													For the cumulative nine months ended Sept 30, 2018 (9MFY18), QES reported a net profit of RM10.65 million on a revenue of RM133.9 million. 
													The group earlier reported a net profit of RM15.03 million for FY17, up 58% from FY16, on the back of a 39% y-o-y growth in revenue to RM190.94 million.

1023, CIMB GROUP HOLDINGS BHD ," Thu, 27 Dec 2018, 10:56 AM ",Review of Top 10 Stock Picks for 2018 - The Edge,,"
				On the local front, a stunning defeat of the long-standing Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition in the May 9 general election threw the local market into a frenzy. BN-linked companies as well as construction stocks were especially hit as the government shelved mega infrastructure projects such as the Chinese-funded US$20 billion East Coast Rail Link, and put others including the mass rapid transit Line 3 and the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high speed rail under review. 
				The intention of the federal government to cut costs also did not bode well for companies such as Gamuda Bhd, as well as toll concessionaires in light of the Pakatan Harapan coalition’s pledge to abolish tolls. Other companies that were hit are those heavily dependent on government concessions, including MyEG Services Bhd and Prestariang Bhd. 
				Global factors also affected the local bourse. The FBM KLCI spent most of the second half of 2018 trading in line with regional markets. The manufacturing and technology sectors were particularly affected in line with their international counterparts. 
				The Edge Financial Daily reviews the stock picks published on Jan 2, 2018, which showed only two out of the 10 stocks recording a gain. 
	  
	 
	Formerly known as UMW Oil & Gas Corp Bhd before its rebranding in May, Velesto Energy Bhd failed to reach an expected turnaround by the end of its financial year ending Dec 31, 2018 (FY18) on lower utilisation of its rigs. 
	The stock was picked on expectations that its utilisation rate would register at 80% in FY18, but it had fallen to 75% in the third quarter of the year. 
	The group’s share price, which shot up to a one-year high of 46 sen on Jan 8, declined throughout the year to an all-time low of 17.5 sen per share on Dec 20. 
	The stock closed down 0.5 sen or 2.78% to 17.5 sen yesterday, leaving the group with a RM1.44 billion market value. 
	Although the group recorded a net profit of RM5 million in its first quarter of 2018 (1QFY18), it fell back into the red in the following two quarters, resulting in a net loss of RM32.6 million over the nine-month period ended Sept 30, 2018 (9MFY18). 
	Revenue has also underperformed in 9MFY18, down 2.73% to RM383.9 million versus RM394.7 million a year ago. 
	In October, Velesto president and executive director Rohaizad Darus told The Edge Malaysia weekly that he believes the worst is over for the company as it had cleaned up its balance sheet and is bidding for some US$500 million worth of jobs. 
	Analysts seem to agree as the counter is still favoured as a “buy” recommendation by five out of seven analysts with an eye on the stock. According to Bloomberg data, the consensus 12-month target price is 30 sen. 
	“With an improving outlook over the next 12 months, any short-term weakness in share price is an opportunity to accumulate,” said Maybank Kim Eng in a Nov 2018 report on Velesto. 
	  
	 
	As a semiconductor manufacturer exposed to supply chain changes of US-based Apple Inc, Inari Amerton Bhd has seen a turn in fortunes from a steady increase in its share price in 2017. 
	In 2018, the stock swung between an all-time high of RM2.53, which it reached on both Jan 8 and Aug 9, and a low of RM1.33 on April 12. This is compared to a doubling of its share price in 2017, when it surged on the back of a strong US dollar to end the year at RM2.19. 
	Inari shares closed at RM1.43 yesterday, down 35% year to date. The group’s market capitalisation stood at RM4.53 billion. 
	The group is largely involved in the production of radio frequency (RF) parts it produces for Apple. However, management has expressed its intention to diversify its revenue streams, including into producing light-emitting diodes for digital billboards. 
	Although the group’s earnings for its financial year ended June 30, 2018 had risen 9.44% to RM249.27 million, quarterly net profit declined from its fourth quarter onwards. 
	Lower volume loading on a major sensor product and the disposal of assets of a 51%-owned subsidiary also dragged Inari’s earnings down 12.02% to RM60.16 million in 1QFY19 ended Sept 30, 2018. Revenue for 1QFY19 declined 12.7% to RM325.72 million year-on-year. 
	Twelve of 17 analysts covering the stock have a “buy” call with a consensus 12-month target price of RM2.07, according to Bloomberg data. 
	“Despite softer loadings at the RF division, we noted of progress with expansion and new projects to diversify its customer and product concentration risk. 
	“We like the group for its double-digit earnings growth prospects on the back of expansion plans, strong margins and robust balance sheet,” TA Securities said in a Nov 28 note. 
	  
	 
	Supported by the expansion of international coffee chain Starbucks across Malaysia, Berjaya Food Bhd (BFood) recorded a 19% growth in net profit for its first half ended Oct 31, 2018 (1HFY19) to RM13.27 million. Revenue for the period was up 4% at RM327.96 million from RM315.17 million previously. 
	The group’s share price, however, did not follow suit. The counter has declined 46 sen or 25.2% year to date, closing at RM1.35 yesterday with a market capitalisation of RM489.92 million. 
	This was despite RM20 million worth of share buy-backs in October, and subsequent acquisitions of shares by major shareholders Berjaya Corp Bhd and tycoon Tan Sri Vincent Tan Chee Yioun. 
	BFood returned to the black as scheduled in the fourth quarter ended April 30, 2018 on a shot in the arm from Starbucks, and subsequently recorded higher year-on-year profits in 1HFY19, partly due to its disposal of loss-making Indonesian Kenny Rogers Roasters (KRR) unit PT Boga Lestari Sentosa Indonesia in November last year. 
	However, its Malaysian KRR operations continue to disappoint, as did its Jollibean brand of restaurants. 
	Looking forward, observers of the stock are still positive on its prospects. 
	“BFood has started to offer its Jollibean brand for franchising. Although minimal, we believe the contribution from franchising will further elevate the group’s earnings growth potential,” AmInvestment Bank said in a Dec 6 report. 
	Cheaper coffee prices are also expected to favour the group, although this is partially offset by a 10% import tax and higher costs from substituting plastic straws, the report noted 
	  
	 
	As Malaysia’s only public listed company providing bunkering services, Straits Inter Logistics Bhd was picked on the basis of strong earnings performance in its 2017 financial year after being rebranded from Raya International Bhd in August that year. 
	With its new direction set, the group’s earnings grew 29.28% to RM2.33 million in 9MFY18 ended Sept 30, 2018, following an 81.06% surge in revenue to RM150.03 million year-on-year. This was the result of growth in the group’s oil bunkering services and trading in oil products. 
	Unfortunately, this has not translated into stronger investor interest in the counter, which has lost 4 sen or 15.4% to 22 sen year to date. Straits Inter Logistics last closed at 22 sen at a market capitalisation of RM122.99 million. 
	On Dec 5, the group proposed to diversify into land transportation and logistics to meet rising demand from its existing customers for such services. 
	The inland transportation business segment could contribute more than a fourth of total net profit in the future, the group said of the plan, which is still subject to shareholders’ approval. 
	It is unclear what the remaining shareholders think as yet, but Straits Inter Logistics managing director and substantial shareholder Datuk Seri Ho Kam Choy has been seen to be mopping up the group’s shares, giving him a total stake of 11.94% as at Dec 12. 
	Ho was appointed to lead the company in August 2017 after the exit of former shareholders and had spent 18 months restructuring the company. 
	  
	 
	Shares in Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd have gained 50 sen or 15.6% year-to-date, closing at RM3.67 yesterday. 
	The company has benefited from strong growth in its operation and maintenance (O&M) activities, posting a 21.4% increase in net profit to RM278.61 million for 9MFY18 ended Sept 30, 2018. Revenue was up 20% year-on-year over the cumulative period to RM2.31 billion. 
	Its growth is driven largely by its overseas investments in the Middle East, where it is involved in O&M and engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning (EPPC) and Tanzania, where it is building a chlor-alkali plant via a joint venture. 
	Despite the group’s strong performance, volatility in oil prices has been seen to affect investor sentiment. This brought Serba Dinamik’s share price off its record high of RM4.26 on Oct 18 since a Feb 2017 listing. 
	The price of Brent crude oil declined from a three-year high of US$86.29 on Oct 3, 2018 to a one-year low of US$58.71 on Nov 30, 2018. 
	That being said, analysts are still wildly positive on the stock. All 10 analysts followed by Bloomberg recommend a “buy” on the stock, with a consensus 12-month target price of RM4.91. 
	In a Nov 28 report, PublicInvest Research highlighted that earnings visibility for Serba Dimaik is backed by a strong outstanding order book of RM7.5 billion over the next three years. 
	  
	 
	Shares in CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, which are 27% owned by sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional Bhd, hit a record high of RM7.16 on April 19. 
	However, post-14th general election, which saw a historical change in government, CIMB shares have declined by 17% from their record high to RM5.92 on May 24. 
	The country’s second-largest banking group also announced a significant change in leadership in 2018, with the departure of its chairman Datuk Seri Nazir Razak. 
	Nazir, the younger brother of former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak, stepped down as CIMB chairman on Oct 20, after an illustrious 29-year career with the bank. 
	Datuk Mohd Nasir Ahmad, the former chief executive officer of Perbadanan Usahawan Nasional Bhd, was then appointed as the new chairman of CIMB. 
	Earnings-wise, CIMB saw a vast improvement in 2018. For the nine months ended Sept 30, 2018 (9MFY18), the group’s net profit rose 31.1% to RM4.47 billion from RM3.41 billion a year ago, while revenue was marginally higher at RM13.31 billion compared with RM13.11 billion. 
	This was underpinned by lower provisions and costs, continued improvement from consumer and commercial banking, as well as a recovery in wholesale banking revenue in 3QFY18. 
	Maybank IB Research said in a Dec 11 note that CIMB’s valuations were undemanding, in light of its year-to-date share price decline. 
	Moreover, the research firm was projecting faster earnings growth of 11% into FY19 for CIMB, on the back of more stable net interest margins and credit costs, leading to a recovery in return on average equity to 10% from 9.4% (excluding one-offs) in FY18. 
	Maybank IB had a “buy” call on CIMB, with a target price of RM6.70. 
	At their closing price of RM5.72 yesterday, CIMB shares are trading at a trailing price-earnings ratio of 9.6 times with an indicated dividend yield of 4.4%. 
	  
	 
	Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd shares hit a 10-year high on Jan 8 at RM3.22. This was shortly after the group announced that it had bagged a RM70 million construction contract from Tenaga Nasional Bhd, for the construction of a reinforced concrete jetty and platform in Johor Baru. 
	Job wins, coupled with higher recurring income courtesy of its concession division namely its stake in all three of Cambodia’s International Airports — Phnom Penh, Siem Reap and Sihanoukville — made Muhibbah a top pick by analysts last year. 
	The group reported a 12.4% increase in net profit to RM106.92 million for the cumulative nine months ended Sept 30, 2018 (9MFY18) while revenue grew 3.4% to RM1.12 billion. 
	In a Nov 29 note on Muhibbah, RHB Research remarked that there were concerns from the investment committee on Muhibbah’s prospects in Cambodia, due to the memorandum of understanding signing between Cambodia and China to develop a new airport in Phnom Penh. 
	However, RHB Research opined that this new airport would not be completed anytime before 2019 and by the time that it is completed, which would be in 2020 or thereafter, Muhibbah’s airports there should reach 90% capacity or more. 
	Muhibbah also has a construction and cranes division, which recently bagged two engineering, procurement, construction, installation and commissioning contracts from two subsidiaries of Petroliam Nasional Bhd. 
	MIDF Research said following the addition of these contracts Muhibbah’s current outstanding order book now stands at RM2.1 billion. The firm also noted that Muhibbah’s tender book currently stands at RM4.1 billion, of which 76% are related to infra jobs, the firm noted. 
	MIDF is maintaining its “buy” call on Muhibbah, with a target price of RM3.15. 
	At its closing price of RM2.81 yesterday, Muhibbah is trading at a trailing price-earnings ratio of 9.42 times with an indicated dividend yield of 2.5%. 
	  
	 
	Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB) was among the casualties of the post-14th general election outcome selling. Its shares, which hit a record high of RM15.80 on May 4 just five days before the election, have since declined by 14% to RM13.54 yesterday. 
	Year to date, TNB shares have declined by 8%, with RM7 billion in market capitalisation wiped out. 
	TNB announced on Dec 14 that the government had approved the continuation of the imbalance cost pass-through mechanism for the period from Jan 1 until June 30, 2019. 
	Due to higher fuel and generation cost for the period of July 1 until Dec 31, 2018, the additional generation cost or imbalance cost is RM1.82 billion. This is mainly due to the increase in average coal price to US$97.835 per tonne, as compared to the forecast coal price set in the Base Tariff for Regulatory Period 2 (RP2) from 2018 to 2020, which is at US$75 per tonne. 
	Alliance DBS Research said in a Dec 17 note that as per the IBR (incentive-based regulation) framework, excess revenue generated will have to be passed through to customers due to the revenue cap and price cap models implemented for TNB’s entities. Higher revenue arising from higher-than-projected electricity volume sales or average selling prices will be returned to customers by offsetting higher generation cost. 
	Following this, AllianceDBS Research revised down its earnings projection for TNB by 1% to 3% to account for lower effective electricity sales as the utility will have to return excess revenue. 
	The firm cut its target price for TNB to RM14.20 following the earnings revision, and reiterated its “hold” rating on the stock. 
	At their close of RM13.54 yesterday, TNB shares are trading at a trailing price-earnings ratio of 13.75 times with an indicated dividend yield of 3.8%. 
	  
	 
	Logistics provider Tasco Bhd was among our top picks in 2018 due to prospects of future growth following its venture into the cold chain market after its takeover of Gold Cold Transport Sdn Bhd, one of the largest cold chain logistics players in Malaysia, and MILS Cold Chain Sdn Bhd last year. 
	However, the stock has turned out as to be worst performer among our picks for the year as its earnings were hampered by finance costs, which more than doubled as a result of loans taken to finance its cold chain business — in spite of the group recording a growth in revenue. 
	For the first half ended Sept 30, 2018 (1HFY19) Tasco reported a 52% decline in net profit to RM7.78 million on increased finance costs for its cold chain business as well as its recent acquisition of land and warehouse on Pulau Indah in Selangor. 
	This was on the back of a 7% increase in 1HFY19 revenue to RM372.7 million. 
	Following this, its share price hit a four-year low of RM1.02 on Nov 27. 
	In a Nov 16 note to investors, MIDF Research downgraded its call on Tasco to “neutral” from “buy”, with a target price of RM1.28 per share. 
	The firm said that its revised valuation target represents its further conservatism in valuation of Tasco amid increasing competition and uncertainty of global trade. 
	“While Tasco’s retail logistics business focuses mostly on petrol kiosks and convenience stores, which we reckon its demand to be resilient, contribution to the bottom line is expected to be minimal. “Nevertheless, we note that Tasco has a manageable net debt to equity ratio below 1 time despite increased financing costs,” the firm said. 
	At its closing price of RM1 yesterday, Tasco is trading at a trailing price-earnings ratio of 9.51 times with an indicated dividend yield of 5%. 
	  
	 
	MKH Bhd, which is primarily involved in property development, construction, and plantation, was one of our top picks last year premised on the expectation of a stable crude palm oil (CPO) price, at above RM2,300 per tonne, which could help boost its plantation earnings. 
	However, CPO prices started to decline below the perceived stable level of RM2,300 per tonne in the second half of the year, falling to as low as RM1,775 per tonne on Nov 16. 
	For its full financial year ended Sept 30, 2018 (FY18), MKH reported a 46% drop in net profit to RM69.03 million, while revenue increased marginally to RM1.08 billion, from RM1.06 billion in FY17. 
	Its plantation operations located in East Kalimantan, Indonesia saw lower earnings due to the weakening of the rupiah against the US dollar and the ringgit. 
	MKH’s property division saw a lower gross profit margin as a result of competitive sales rebates offered to purchasers for certain development projects. 
	AllianceDBS Research in a Oct 17 note on MKH acknowledged that the group’s share price had dropped significantly over the past one year on weak earnings delivery concerns. 
	The firm noted that a potential earnings catalyst for MKH was its 500 acres (202ha) of land bank in Kajang which are carried at low cost, that could underpin its launch pipeline of affordably priced properties going forward. 
	Year to date, MKH’s share price has declined by 29% to close at RM1.12 yesterday, with a market capitalisation of RM648.59 million.

1023, CIMB GROUP HOLDINGS BHD ," Wed, 19 Dec 2018, 9:51 AM ",PublicInvest Research Headlines - 19 Dec 2018,Economy Markets MARKET UPDATE," US homebuilding rebounded in Nov, driven by a surge in multi-family housing projects, but construction of single-family homes fell to a 1-1/2- year low, pointing to deepening housing market weakness that could spill over to the broader economy. The report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday also showed housing starts fell in Oct instead of rising as previously reported. Underscoring the housing market weakness, single-family home completions dropped for a third straight month in Nov to their lowest level in more than a year. Housing starts increased 3.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.256m units last month. Data for Oct was revised down to show starts dropping to a rate of 1.217m units instead of the previously reported pace of 1.228m units. (Reuters)  The US and China are planning to hold meetings in Jan to “document an agreement” on trade, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Bloomberg in an interview on Tuesday. Mnuchin was quoted as saying the two sides had held several phone conversations in recent weeks, and were planning further formal talks. Trump administration officials had not disclosed plans for face-to-face meetings since a Dec 1 trade truce reached between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping led to a delay in planned US tariff increase until March 2. (Bloomberg)  German business sentiment deteriorated further to its lowest level in more than two years as trade tensions and the rising risk of a no-deal Brexit threaten to hamper a meaningful economic rebound from a summer lull. The Ifo Institute’s gauge of corporate confidence in Europe’s largest economy fell to 101.0 in Dec from 102.0 in Nov. The fourth straight decline will add to concerns about economic prospects in Germany and the 19-nation euro area after the ECB decided to rein in stimulus. The report suggests Germany may have to overcome bigger hurdles than new emissions-testing rules, which hit the auto industry in the third quarter and led to a contraction in economic output. Gauges for current conditions and expectations both decreased. Worsening confidence will spark speculation whether the ECB was right to cap quantitative easing at EUR2.6trn (USD3trn). (Bloomberg)  The British government said it would implement plans for a no-deal Brexit in full and begin telling businesses and citizens to prepare for the risk of leaving the EU without an agreement. Those plans include setting aside space on ferries to ensure a regular flow of medical supplies and keeping 3,500 armed forces personnel ready to support the government with its contingency plans. With just over 100 days until Britain is due to leave the EU, Prime Minister Theresa May is yet to win the support of a deeply divided parliament for the deal she struck last month with Brussels to maintain close ties with the bloc. (Reuters)  China moved a step closer to launching a formal World Trade Organization inquiry into whether President Donald Trump’s USD250bn in tariffs against Chinese goods violate international trade rules, a process that could move forward next month. The US rejected China’s first request for a WTO inquiry in the matter, according to a participant at Tuesday’s dispute-settlement meeting. The trade body’s rules prevent the US from blocking a dispute inquiry if China returns with a second request at the next WTO dispute-settlement meeting. The next such meeting is set for Jan. 28; the WTO could hold a special session before then to hear China’s second request. (Bloomberg)  Japan’s output gap in 3Q turned negative for the first time in almost two years, in a sign the BOJ’s 2% inflation target will become even more distant due to waning price pressure. A negative output gap occurs when actual output is less than the economy’s full capacity and is considered a sign of weakening demand. Japan’s economy contracted in 3Q by the most in four years due to a strong earthquake, severe floods and worries about global trade friction. Japanese companies quickly rebounded from the natural disasters, but there are worries that China’s economic slowdown from its trade war with the US will have a more lasting negative impact on Japan’s economy. (Reuters)  The World Bank has once again lowered its GDP growth expectation for Malaysia this year to 4.7% from a 4.9% prediction set in early Oct 2018. This is due to two factors, namely lower government spending and a decline in private and public investment. In addition to moderating growth, risks are increasingly skewed towards the downside. A key concern domestically is the narrow fiscal space the government has, to cope with shocks, especially due to steeply declining revenue and high level of public debt. It is important that efforts to sustain growth in the near term are carefully balanced with the need to restore fiscal buffers. That being said, even in the face of a potential recession in developed nations next year, Malaysia's economy is expected to remain resilient with the World Bank maintaining its 4.7% GDP growth forecast for 2019. (The Edge)  TP: RM6.50): Expected to recognize RM200m gain from transfer of Malaysian stockbroking business to Jupiter. CIMB Group Holdings is estimated to record a gain on disposal of RM200m from the proposed transfer of its stockbroking business to Jupiter Securities SB. The consideration in connection with the business transfer will be satisfied in cash. It was determined based on the future prospects and net asset value of the in-scope business as at Dec 31 2015, which amounted to RM565.6m. (The Edge)  While the RM200m disposal gain expected is much welcomed, the Group's exposure to the China market (which had already commenced early this year) is a bigger boost. Our Outperform call and RM6.50 target price remain unchanged.  Telekom Malaysia (TM) have to date upgraded close to 60% out of over 340,000 Streamyx customers' high-speed Internet packages in unifi-coverage areas to unifi at the same price of their current plans, to widen the nation's broadband coverage. Thus far, close to 70% of upgradable packages owned by Streamyx customers in non-unifi coverage areas have been moved up to double their current Streamyx speed, where technology permits, at the same price of current plan. (The Edge)  Malayan Banking is expecting a 20% jump in Amanah Saham Nasional (ASNB) transactions through the bank's platforms in the next one year, with the introduction of 2 new online services. Permodalan Nasional (PNB) and Maybank launched two 2 services to provide enhanced convenience and accessibility for ASNB customers to make investments via digital channels. (The Edge)  Malaysia Airports Holdings (MAHB) expects the passenger movement at the KLIA main terminal and klia2 to surge by 12% and 21%, respectively, this month, which is considered a super-peak travel period. The airport operator projected a total of 6.9m passengers travelling via KLIA during this school holidays and Christmas festive season. The super-peak period at the KLIA’s main terminal is likely to last until Dec 23, 2018. (The Edge)  Property developer Crescendo Corp is buying a piece of land in Johor Bahru for RM13m to develop apartments for rent by Crescendo International College students. Crescendo’s wholly-owned unit Crescendo Education SB owns a 55% stake in Crescendo International College. The group is buying the land from Panoramic Housing Development SB, a related party. (The Edge)  Apex Equity Holdings and its JF Apex Securities have inked a business merger agreement (BMA) with Mercury Securities, following a preliminary agreement they entered into on Sept 21. Under the BMA, Apex Equity will be taking over Mercury Securities’ stockbroking, corporate advisory and other related businesses for RM140m, and transfer to JF Apex. (The Edge) The FBM KLCI might open flat today as an extremely choppy session on Wall Street saw the S&P 500 swing from gains to losses and back before closing barely changed, with oil prices under severe pressure as participants continued to focus on concerns over global growth, the US-China trade spat and tighter central bank policy. So-called “haven” currencies such as the Japanese yen continued to attract demand, while US Treasuries and gold edged higher. As a two-day meeting of the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee got under way, expectations for a rate rise remained high — although speculation has mounted that the central bank might adopt a more dovish stance in its policy forecasts for next year. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 finished just a fraction higher at 2,546 — snapping a three-day run of losses — after climbing as high as 2,574 earlier in the day. The energy sector fell 1.9%. The S&P recorded its lowest close since early October 2017 in the previous session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 0.4% higher, while the Nasdaq Composite index gained 0.5%. Across the Atlantic, the pan-European Stoxx 600 fell 0.8% — led by the utilities and energy sectors — as the FTSE 100 in London shed 1.1% and the Xetra Dax in Frankfurt slipped 0.3%. Back home, the FBM KLCI index lost 6.31 points or 0.38% to 1,635.31 points on Tuesday. Trading volume increased to 2.27bn worth RM1.91bn. Market breadth was negative with 222 gainers as compared to 699 losers. In the region, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index lost 1.1% as heavily weighted technology stocks lost ground, while mainland China’s CSI 300 fell 1%. Tokyo’s Topix fell 2% to its lowest level in 18 months.   Source:   - 19 Dec 2018"

1023, CIMB GROUP HOLDINGS BHD ," Wed, 19 Dec 2018, 9:09 AM ",Banking - 3Q Results Review: No Change in Our View of Moderation Ahead,," With 7 in-line estimates, 2 (BIMB and RHBBANK) were above estimates with only CIMB below due to weak fee-based income, below target loans and downside pressure on NIM (mostly from Indonesia). Both BIMB and RHBBANK benefited from lower-than-expected impairment allowances supported by higher-than-expected financing (BIMB) and better-than-expected NIM and Islamic banking income (RHBBANK).  Sequentially, earnings improved by +6.0% QoQ, pushed by CIMB (+14% QoQ as fee-based income rebound +20% QoQ)) and HLBANK (+13% QoQ supported by +24% QoQ surge from BOCD to RM146m) to RM6,760m. Only ABMB, MAYBANK and PBBANK saw relatively flat performance while RHBBANK improved by +1.5% QoQ to RM579m. AFFIN’s stellar growth (+97% QoQ to RM145m) were due to lower impairment allowances. Industry’s net profit margins has risen to ~37% in 3Q18 (from its lows of 29% in 2Q16) due to the absence of large-scale impairment allowances) comparable to 2012’s net profit margin of ~38%.  Loans slowed both sequentially (-10bps to +1.5%) and yearly (-30bps to +4.7%). QoQ, the deceleration was led by HLBANK (-230bps to +0.6%), MAYBANK (-70bps to 1.1%) and AMBANK (-60bps to +1.6%). Bucking the trend was AMBM and CIMB (+80bps each to +1.2% and +2.6% respectively) with RHBBANK adding another 170bps to 1.8% QoQ. Overall loans growth is trending upwards after hitting its 5-year low of +2.1% YoY in 4Q17.  All banks saw positive growth for the quarter except for MAYBANK, which was relatively down (-0.6%) due to strategic reasons. As deposits outpaced loans, loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) fell marginally by 10bps to 94.2%. YoY LDR saw an uptick of 100bps. In terms of liquidity, HLBANK saw a healthier liquidity as its LDR was below industry average at 81.7% followed by AFFIN at 88.1%. Overall liquidity in the industry is mixed as loan-to-fund ratio is at the 81% mark (+40bps QoQ) vs industry’s LDR of 94.2% (vs their respective 5-year low of 87% and 74%, respectively, in 3Q13). As credit demand is expected to be moderate moving forward, we opined liquidity is ample for now.  QoQ, NIM widened slightly by +2bps to 2.24% (vs 5-year high of 2.43% in 3Q13) led by BIMB (+24bps) due to better repricing of assets with cost of funds stable. Overall, the industry saw little traction in NIM due to deposit intakes still intensive and absence of further rate hike as seen in Jan 18. Downside pressure on NIM seems abated ahead with the deferment of compliance to the NSFR until 2020 with some banks likely to review their strategy of shoring their deposits as was seen in 1H18. However, we still see compression ahead as banks will face competition in shoring their low-cost funding via SMEs traction.  After 2 consecutive quarters, 3Q saw a rebound in the banks fee-based income, growing at +3.1% QoQ. Fee-based income contribution of ~25% in 3Q is amongst the lowest vs 4Q13 contribution of 32%. Improvements were seen at most banks with the exception of ABMB and MAYBANK whose fee-based income saw negative growth at 13% and 16%, respectively. Uncertainties both in the external and domestic front have undermined capital markets with fee-based income continues to decline YoY (-9.8% vs -8.7% in 2Q).  QoQ, Cost-to-Income ratio (CIR) improved by falling 20bps to 46.6%. Both MAYBANK and MBSB saw upticks in CIR due to establishment costs (MAYBANK) and transition into a fully banking platform (MBSB) but still within guidance for both. Overall, the industry saw lower CIR as topline outpaces expenses. YoY, CIR fell (-155bps) for the third consecutive quarters. We view the industry will still see disciplined cost management ahead in light of challenging earnings.  with gross impaired loans ratio (GIL) falling by 2bps QoQ and 11bps YoY to 2.12%. YoY, improvements can be seen at CIMB (-350bps), CIMB (-38bps) and HLBANK (-17bps). While GIL has been above the 2% mark since 2Q16, we opined that GIL to trend downwards on account of the stable economy domestically and across the region which will augur well for both business and households, but we do not discount volatility on energy prices, which will impact those assets, which are tied to the sector. Those that will be impacted to the volatility will likely be from CIMB, MAYBANK and RHBBANK. The improvement in asset quality is manifesting in the decline in impairment allowances. Credit charges are lower both QoQ (-5bps) and YoY(-6bps) to 0.26% and way below the range of 0.45%-0.48% recorded in 2016. The steep fall in MBSB’s credit charge is attributed to overprovisions in the previous quarters while the strength of HLBANK and PBBANK credit charge (both at 0.06%) is a testament of their efficiency in asset selection. Going forward, we feel that current credit charge costs will be the new norm given the stable economy and employment. We, however, see risks from banks exposed to large corporations and energy/commodity-related activities that will give volatility in credit costs given the prevailing uncertainties external headwinds.  Overall, the banks’ CET1 ratios are still comfortably above the regulatory requirements of 7% (4.5% equity capital + 2.5% capital conservation buffer. Impact of MSFR9 seems to be muted. From BNM’s 1H18 Financial Stability Report, the central bank seems satisfied with the improving asset quality and the current CET1 and Capital (industry capital ratio at ~17%) ratios. We opined that the central bank does not see a major shock in the system in the short term thus, satisfied with the present Capital Adequacy Ratios. Source:   - 19 Dec 2018"

1023, CIMB GROUP HOLDINGS BHD ," Tue, 18 Dec 2018, 9:46 AM ",PublicInvest Research Headlines - 18 Dec 2018,Economy Markets Market Update," Federal Reserve officials will debate this week how to signal less certainty over the path of interest rates without implying they are done raising them after their two-day policy meeting ends Wednesday. One challenge is deciding how to alter the Fed’s post-meeting policy statement. Since the central bank began raising rates three years ago, it has indicated the potential for “gradual increases.” It signaled greater confidence in the path since Jan, when it started saying it expected “further gradual increases.” Officials have been debating how and when to usher this language out of the statement now that their policy path looks less certain than it did just three months ago. They are likely to raise their benchmark federal funds rate to a range between 2.25% and 2.5% at this week’s meeting, the fourth such increase this year. (The Wall Street Journal)  The Trump administration on Monday finalized a regulation limiting the ability of US wineries and global alcohol companies to reduce import taxes. In the government’s view, the new rules stop wine and spirits companies from double-dipping on tax breaks. The government contends that the companies are getting or seeking a tax advantage for imports over domestic production. The change will yield more than USD600m for the government over the next decade by reversing the tax treatment the wine industry now gets and potentially prevent billions of dollars more in refund claims from spirits companies and others seeking similar rulings, according to the rule from the Treasury Department and US Customs and Border Protection. (The Wall Street Journal)  After reporting a sharp pullback in US homebuilder confidence in the previous month, the National Association of Home Builders released a report unexpectedly showing a continued deterioration in confidence in the month of Dec. The report said the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index dropped to 56 in Dec after tumbling to 60 in Nov. Economists had expected the index to inch up to 61. With the unexpected monthly decrease, the housing market index tumbled to its lowest level since hitting 54 in May of 2015. The fact that builder confidence dropped significantly in areas of the country with high home prices shows how the growing housing affordability crisis is hurting the market. This housing slowdown is an early indicator of economic softening, and it is important that builders manage supply side costs to keep home prices competitive for buyers at different price points. (RTT)  The US has welcomed Chinese concessions since the two declared a trade war truce in early Dec, but trade experts and people familiar with negotiations say Beijing needs to do far more to meet US demands for long-term change in how China does business. US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, agreed on Dec 1 in Buenos Aires to stop escalating tit-for-tat tariffs that have disrupted the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars of goods between the world’s two biggest economies. Since then, Beijing has resumed buying US soybeans, the single largest agricultural export between the two countries. China has also cut tariffs on imports of cars from the United States, dialled back on an industrial development plan known as “Made in China 2025,” and told its state refiners to buy more US oil. (Reuters)  Four days after the ECB decided to end asset purchases, data showed a larger-than-anticipated slowdown in euro-area inflation. Consumer price growth slipped to 1.9% in Nov, the least since May, from 2.2% the previous month. That’s below the initial estimate of 2%. A measure stripping out volatile components such as food and energy that’s closely watched by policy makers was unrevised at 1%. Since the ECB’s Governing Council devised plans in the summer to halt quantitative easing at EUR2.6trn (USD3trn) by the end of the year, the economy has showed signs of weakening momentum. Output contracted in two of the region’s three largest economies in the third quarter, and confidence in a strong rebound have diminished amid trade tensions, the threat of a no-deal Brexit and Italy’s fiscal troubles. (Bloomberg)  As the risks to the global economy rises, the BOJ is expected to join a chorus of warnings from other policy-makers of the threat to growth from protectionism and signal its resolve to keep the money spigot open. At this week’s policy review, the BOJ is seen maintaining its ultra-easy monetary settings even as years of heavy bond buying dries up market liquidity and hurts bank profits, leaving it well behind its US and European counterparts in dialing back crisis-mode stimulus. Adding to the plight of narrowing margins for financial institutions, the 10-year yield hit a five-month low of 0.025% on Monday as investors flocked to the safety of Japanese government bonds. (Reuters)  Singapore’s exports fell for the first time in eight months on a YoY basis in Nov with shipments to China, its biggest market, continuing their decline on slowing growth in the world’s second largest economy. The contraction comes as economists grow increasingly worried about the impact of Sino-US trade tensions on demand from China, with many expecting the dispute to hurt the city-state’s trade dependent economy in months to come. Singapore’s non-oil domestic exports fell 2.6% in Nov YoY, a sharp contrast to the 1.2% increase predicted by economists in a Reuters poll, according to the data from trade agency International Enterprise Singapore. It was also sharply down from the revised 8.2% rise the month before and the first negative reading since March. (Reuters)  Private home sales in Singapore more than doubled in Nov from Oct as developers marketed more projects. Home builders in the city-state sold 1,198 units last month versus 487 apartments in Oct, the Urban Redevelopment Authority said. Home sales rose to the highest since July. One of the main reasons for the advance is as simple as home builders bringing more new projects to market. They included condos with pools, leisure areas and landscape gardens such as Kent Ridge Hill Residences, Parc Esta, Whistler Grand and Belgravia Green. The total number of apartments put up for sale last month was 1,341, compared with 202 in Oct. (Bloomberg)  Indonesia posted its widest trade deficit in more than five years in Nov as exports fell, adding pressure on the currency. The trade deficit was USD2.1bn, much bigger than the USD735m shortfall predicted by economists in a Bloomberg survey, and the worst result since July 2013. Imports jumped 11.7% from a year earlier, according to figures released by the statistics bureau. Interestingly, that is the weakest pace since March after the government adopted measures to reduce imports, including higher tariffs on some goods. Exports fell 3.3%, its first decline since June 2017. (Bloomberg)  CIMB Group Holdings has filed and served a notice of arbitration against PLUS Malaysia, claiming the latter had breached its obligations under a joint venture agreement in relation to Touch 'N Go SB by launching its own toll collection system. PLUS breached its obligations under the 1998 JVA by commencing and launching its own PLUS Radio Frequency Identification System. Under the JVA, CIMB has a 52% stake in Touch ‘N Go, while PLUS and MTD Equity SB hold 28% and 20% respectively. (The Edge)  Destini has won a 3-year contract for the provision of tubular handling, conductor installation and slot recovery equipment and services for Petronas Carigali SB, the exploration arm of Petroliam Nasional. The contract was awarded to its wholly-owned Destini Oil Services SB (DOS) under the Pan Malaysia Petroleum Arrangement Contractors (PAC) Operators’ Drilling Programme by Petronas Carigali. (The Edge)  Hai-O Enterprise net profit for the 2QFY18 fell 37% to RM13.6m, from RM21.44m a year earlier, on lower sales from its multilevel marketing (MLM) segment. This lowered EPS to 4.68sen from 7.40sen previously. Quarterly revenue fell 25% to RM92.17m from RM123.53m a year ago. Nevertheless, the group declared an interim dividend of 4sen per share, albeit lower than the 6sen declared a year ago. (The Edge)  WZ Satu wholly owned unit WZS BinaRaya SB has bagged a RM133.5m subcontract job to construct bridges from Genuang to Paloh for the Gemas-Johor Baru electrified double track project. The company accepted the letter of award from SIPP-YTL JV for the project and is expected to be completed by May 17, 2020. (The Edge)  Scomi Group confirmed that the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) has terminated the monorail contract awarded to Scomi and its Indian partner 10 years ago. Scomi’s unit Scomi Engineering, and Larsen & Toubro Ltd (L&T), are the two members of a consortium that operates India’s first monorail network. The consortium was awarded the contract for the design, development, construction, operation and maintenance of the 19.5km monorail network in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region in November 2008. (The Edge)  Commercial banks cannot rely on exclusion clauses in agreements to stop their clients from suing for negligence, the Federal Court said. Judge Balia Yusof Wahi said the customer is made to accept the contract as prepared by the other party in today’s commercial world. Balia said this when dismissing an appeal by CIMB Bank brought by a British couple over a banking error that cost them a property in Kuala Lumpur. In this particular instance, where a customer had brought a suit against the bank, he said it merited public policy for the court to interfere. (The Edge) The FBM KLCI might open lower today after growing concerns over the health of the global economy pushed US stocks sharply lower for the second day in a row overnight as participants awaited the outcome of a two-day meeting of the Federal Reserve’s policy setting Open Market Committee. The S&P 500 recorded its lowest close since October 2017 after an early attempt to rally ran out of steam. The dollar eased back from a 16-month high touched on Friday against a basket of currencies, with the yen and Swiss franc in particular gaining ground, while the nervous mood across equity markets helped fuel demand for US Treasuries. The big focus this week will be the Fed’s decision on interest rates on Wednesday — a 25 basis point rise is widely expected — and whether the central bank signals fewer increases next year via its “dot plot” projections, particularly given a more “dovish” shift in its communications. Recent gloomy data releases in China and the eurozone have highlighted a darkening outlook for global growth, while an inversion across part of the US Treasury yield curve has been viewed by some as a warning that recession may not be too far away. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 fell 2.1% at 2,545, its lowest finish since October 9 2017, with all of its sectors ending in the red. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also finished 2.1% lower, while the Nasdaq Composite shed 2.2%. In Europe, the pan-regional Stoxx 600 fell 1.1% — having been down 1.4% at one point — as the Xetra Dax in Frankfurt shed 0.9% and London’s FTSE 100 ended 1.1% lower. Back home, the FBM KLCI index lost 20.34 points or 1.22% to 1,641.62 points on Monday. Trading volume decreased to 1.47bn worth RM1.18bn. Market breadth was negative with 179 gainers as compared to 690 losers. In the region, the CSI 300 index of major Shanghai and Shenzhen stocks closed 0.2% down. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng also finished marginally lower. The picture was brighter in Japan, with Tokyo’s Topix adding 0.2%. Source:   - 18 Dec 2018"

The sector’s 9M18 core net profit (RM20.0bn) was within our expectations, accounting for 75.7% of our 2018E banking universe’s net earnings projection of RM26bn (prior to a -3.1% revision). We have adjusted down our earnings forecasts for Hong Leong Bank (-9.1% for CY2018E) and Public Bank (-3.2% CY2018E) during the reporting period while our forecasts and rating for RHB Bank has been upgraded to BUY. Both CIMB and Maybank’s EPS forecasts were revised down before the 3Q18 results announcement. The sector’s drivers for 3Q18 was no different from 2Q18, underpinned by 3Q18 fund-based income (+1.6% yoy; +1.5% qoq) as sequential NIM pressure eased, though the average 9M18 NIM was down about 2bps yoy to 2.28%. Meanwhile, non-interest income continued to disappoint yoy and qoq due to weak investment results. On provisions, the 9M18 provisioning trend continued to improve, down 21% yoy. We reaffirm our  rating on the sector, which is trading at a 2019E P/BV multiple of 1.3x vs. the past 10-year average of 1.52x and past 5-year average of 1.4x. Our top picks are: i)  , which remains an aggressive player in the banking and capital markets; ii) , whereby we are more positive on its outlook driven by firmer receivables yield and value-chain transformation initiatives. Upside/downside risks: funding cost easing/pressure, stronger/weaker loan growth.

The sector’s 9M18 core net profit (RM20.0bn) was within our expectations, accounting for 75.7% of our 2018E banking universe’s net earnings projection of RM26bn (prior to a -2.2% revision). During the quarter, we have adjusted down our earnings forecasts for Hong Leong Bank (-1%/-7.5%/-5.7% for CY2018E/19E/20E, taking into account the impact of higher funding costs and a divestment gain of RM72.2m booked in 3QCY18.

Rating downgraded from BUY to HOLD) during the reporting period. Meanwhile. our forecasts for RHB Bank has been raised by +6.2%/+6.9%/+6.8% for 2018E/19E/20E, as we factor in lower net credit cost assumptions of 25bps from 35bps while rating was upgraded to BUY (from HOLD). Both CIMB and Maybank’s EPS forecasts have been revised down by 1.2- 6.2% and 1.5%-5.2% respectively for FY18E-20E before the 3Q18 results announcement. During this period we have downgraded CIMB Group from BUY to HOLD (Price Target RM6.10 based on a 1.14x CY19E target P/BV), citing a less upbeat earnings outlook due to a weaker operating outlook in Indonesia, driven by rising funding pressure and slower loan growth. For Maybank (BUY, Price Target RM11.20 based on 1.6x 2019E target P/BV), it is expected to face a more challenging 2H18, in anticipation of its high funding cost, potentially higher provisions (likely in 2019) and slower corporate and commercial lending activities, though supported by its resilient consumer financial services division. All in all, the net impact from these net profit revisions for our banking sector universe was -2.2%/-3.8%/-3.1% for 2018E/19E/20E. Post-revisions, we are forecasting a +3.9% yoy growth in the sector’s 2018E core net profit, +3.1% yoy growth in 2019E and a 4.7% yoy growth in 2020E. The core net profit estimates have excluded the asset disposal gains at CIMB (totalling RM1.13bn from the sale of a 50% stake in CIMB Securities International and reduction of its stakes in CIMB-Principal Asset Management and CIMB-Principal Islamic Asset Management), as well as HLB’s RM72.2m profit from the sale of its 37% stake in a consumer credit JV company with the Bank of Chengdu) and non-recurring expenditures (at AMMB and Alliance). On a core EPS growth basis: 2018E +0.9% yoy; 2019E +1.1% yoy; 2020E +2.7% yoy. Meanwhile, based on reported headline net profit, our forecasts are: 2018E growth at +8.1% yoy, 2019E at -1.2% yoy and 2020E at +4.7% yoy (on an EPS growth basis: 2018E +3.3% yoy; 2019E -1.0% yoy; 2020E +2.1% yoy).

1023, CIMB GROUP HOLDINGS BHD ," Fri, 30 Nov 2018, 10:46 AM ",CIMB Group Holdings Berhad - Robust Loans Growth and Stable NIM,INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS FORECAST VALUATION AND RECOMMENDATION," The Group 9MFY18 normalised earnings was within our and expectations, coming in at 71.0% and 74.5% of respective full year estimates. The normalised net profit excluded the CPAM & CPIAM gain of RM928m but included the CSI gain of RM163m. On a reported net profit basis, it was 77.9% and 82.8% of ours and consensus' unadjusted full year estimate respectively.  Total provisions fell -26.8%yoy due to lower loans provisions. It was lower -30.7%yoy to RM1.14b as consumer and commercial segment improved by -53.2%yoy and -48.6%yoy respectively. As for 9MFY18 OPEX, it fell by -6.4%yoy due mainly from deconsolidation of CSI and forex impact. If we exclude the forex impact, OPEX will still have improved by -2.1%yoy.  The 9MFY18 NII and NOII posted a decline of -3.7%yoy and -10.0%yoy respectively. The insipid NII was due to NIM contraction in Indonesia and, softer commercial and wholesale banking, while NOII was impacted by weak capital market in Malaysia in 2QFY18. However, as we had expected, income in 3QFY18 showed an improvement from 2QFY18. Total income grew +5.2%qoq with NII and NOII expanding +2.4%qoq and +13.4%qoq. While this was still lower than in 3QFY17, we opine it was encouraging as moderate the decline seen in 1HFY18.  Group gross loans as at 3QFY18 grew by +4.9%yoy to RM338.4b. In loans currency terms, group gross loans expanded +7.3%yoy. Malaysia saw the highest growth rate of +11.0%yoy with consumer segment growing +8.4%yoy. Of this, mortgages grew +9.7%yoy.  Group deposits increased +3.7%yoy to RM367.0b, faster than +1.5%yoy posted as at 2QFY18. This was led by wholesale banking which grew +10.9%yoy to RM157.3b. In local currency term, deposits grew +6.0%yoy, with Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore expanded +4.4%yoy, +3.8%yoy, +5.6%yoy and +8.7%yoy respectively. ew also note that CASA in Malaysia grew +6.1%yoy.  Recall, the management is targeting the following for FY18; (1) ROE of 10.5%, (2) Dividend payout ratio of 40-60%, (3) total loans growth of +6.0%yoy, (4) credit cost of 0.55-0.60%, (5) CET1 ratio of 12.0% and (6) CI of 50.0%. It seems that the Group is on track to achieve its targets except for its ROE target. Income remained weak but appear to be improving but in our opinion will not be enough to boost earnings to reach its ROE target. In addition, macroeconomic uncertainties will play a factor. However, we foresee ROE to be close to current level which is still decent in our opinion. We tweaked our core net profit in FY18 downwards by -5.1% and FY19 net profit by -7.8% as we believe current macroeconomic uncertainties warrant some conservatism. We opine that the Group perform well given current circumstances in Indonesia and the soft market conditions in 2QFY18 in Malaysia. It was able to mitigate the contraction in income by containing cost and provisions. Besides, income seems to be improving and we believe the robust loans growth will give some uplift in NII. With no significant change to the Group's fundamental, we are maintaining our  call. However, we are adjusting our  (from RM7.85) as we had tweaked our FY19 earnings forecast. Our TP is based on pegging its FY19 BVPS to a PBV of 1.3x. Source:   - 30 Nov 2018"

NIM continued to be under pressure falling >20bps to 2.4% (due to pressure from Niaga). Bulk of the weak NOII was due to lower gains in dividend and brokerage income (RM141m vs 9M17: RM363m).

In terms of PBT contribution, Malaysia fell 2ppt (from 9M17) to 65%, with Indonesia fell 2ppt to 18% with Thailand and Singapore at +3 and 1+ppt to 7% both.

1023, CIMB GROUP HOLDINGS BHD ," Fri, 23 Nov 2018, 10:35 AM ",Another round of GLC shake-ups,,"
		PETALING JAYA: A fresh wave of change at government-linked outfits appears to be happening, with at least two chief executive officers (CEOs) being rumoured to leave their respective organisations in the near future. 
		Among those that could go soon, according to sources, are from the banking industry, namely, RHB Bank Bhd managing director Datuk Khairussaleh Ramli and  CEO Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Aziz. 
		Other CEOs likely to leave are those currently serving at smaller financial institutions, and construction and property firms that are owned by government-linked entities. 
		These changes come hot on the heels of Syed Hamadah Othman replacing Datuk Wan Kamaruzaman Wan Ahmad at Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (Diperbadankan) early this month. 
		“It appears that the corporate purge is far from over...the new government wants a clean sweep (of the old guards),” said a source. 
		Wan Kamaruzaman, better known as Wan K, had led one of the country’s biggest pension funds for five years. 
		Just last Friday,  ’s acting group CEO, Datuk Bazlan Osman, announced his resignation, which took effect immediately. 
		Bazlan was appointed to the post in June following the departure of Datuk Seri Mohammed Shazalli Ramly. 
		He will, however, remain as the company’s executive director until Feb 28, 2019 as part of a transition deal. 
		Earlier in September, Nik Amlizan Mohamed was appointed as the new CEO of Armed Forces fund LTAT, replacing Tan Sri Lodin Wok Kamaruddin, who had led the fund for 36 years. 
		These changes follow the initial winds of change which occurred post-May 9 – the historic day which saw the first ever change of a ruling party in Malaysia. 
		Following the formation of a new government, among the big names that were removed almost immediately were Tan Sri Abdul Wahid Omar and Tan Sri Azman Mokhtar, formerly of Permodalan Nasional Bhd and Khazanah Nasional Bhd, respectively. 
		Other top brass who have left since include Bank Negara governor Tan Sri Muhammad Ibrahim ( ) and  ’s Datuk Badlisham Ghazali, whose contract was not renewed. 
		Since May 9, there has been a disquiet that has been building up among government-linked companies (GLCs). 
		Upon taking over, the new government had said that there was a need to review the role of GLCs and the remuneration paid out to their top executives and senior management. 
		The Pakatan Harapan government is understood to have started mulling over making drastic changes in the appointment and remuneration of key directors at these entities, which include government agencies, right after taking over, and is still doing so. 
		It is worthwhile to note that after much speculation, CIMB’s ex-chairman Datuk Seri Nazir Razak – who is the brother of ousted premier Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak – left the banking group in September after 29 years at the lender. 
		More recently, the country’s second-largest lender announced a slew of major changes among its key management, including the appointment of Khairulanwar Rifaie, who is currently the chief financial officer (CFO) of CIMB Malaysia and CIMB Islamic Bank Bhd, as group CFO. 
		Current group CFO Shahnaz Jammal will relinquish his position to become CEO of the group’s wholesale banking business. 
		It is also understood that a couple of Tengku Zafrul’s key lieutenants have recently vacated, or will soon leave, their positions to join other outfits. 
		At RHB, there has also been a recent spate of management changes. 
		Omar Siddiq recently resigned as RHB’s head of group wholesale banking, joining CIMB as group chief operating officer. 
		Earlier in the year, head of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) Soon Poh Lean and one of the lender’s key M&A team members, Theresa Lim, resigned from the bank.

CIMB Niaga, a 97.9% subsidiary of CIMB Group recorded a core net profit (CNP) of IDR2.59t for 9M18 which was in line with our/market expectations accounting for 79% of both full-year estimates. CNP growth of +18% YoY was primarily driven by lower impairment allowances (-23% YoY) as topline slumbers.  . Topline was abysmal, marginally up (+0.5% YoY) to IDR12,670b underpinned by improved NOII (+13.1% YoY) and dragged by falling NII (-3.8% YoY) to IDR9,012b. The weak NII was due to slower loans (-80bps to +2.2% YoY and within guidance of low single- digit) coupled with weakening NIM falling by 53bps to 5.0% (within guidance). Asset quality continued to improve as GIL and credit costs fell 54bps each to 3.4% and 1.8% (within guidance) respectively. .   basis, earnings fell 7.5% to IDR824.1b dragged by higher impairment allowances of IDR820.8b (+12.7%) and higher opex (+8.7%) to IDR2,098b. Topline rebounded for the quarter improving at +6.2% driven by rebound in both NII and NOII at +2.3% and +16.2% respectively. NII was boosted by better NIM with an uptick of 12bps to 5.0% (due to higher CASA and better repricing of assets) as loans growth faltered (-1.6%). For the quarter, asset quality deteriorated slightly with GIL and credit costs up 2bps and 7bps, respectively, to 3.4% (mostly coming from consumer and corporate) and 1.8% respectively.  As guided previously by management Niaga’s full-year earnings and beyond looks challenging with loans stifled by the i) upcoming impending elections and ii) Niaga not participating in the infra loans space. While FY18E NIM is expected at ~5%, we do not discount of additional downside pressure on NIM on account of further rate hikes as Indonesia’s Central bank defends the Rupiah. While asset quality YoY showed improvement, deterioration is expected ahead as interest rate slowly creeps northwards. we wait for its 9M18 results expected at the end of the month. Our FY18E/FY19E earnings are kept unchanged at RM4.99b/4.98b, as we render existing assumptions to be conservative enough. Our FY18EFY19E assumptions are; i) Loans to grow at 6%/5.2%, ii) Credit charge of ~55bps for both years, iii) NIM compression by 5bps for FY18E and ROE at <10%/<9%.  for the Group based on a FY19E PB/PE of 1.0x/12.0x.

Its 9MFY18 net profit grew +18.0%yoy as provisions were lower by -26.8%yoy. Meanwhile, its 3QFY18 provisions fell -26.3%yoy.  NOII for 9MFY18 grew by +23.6%yoy with 3QFY18 NOII expanding +9.9%yoy. This relieved some of the pressure to NII as it fell -3.8%yoy in 9MFY18. The NOII growth was mainly lead by improvements of +1.1%yoy to IDR1.45t in fees and commissions income, +84.6%yoy to IDR491b in recovery, and +42.7%yoy to IDR685b in gains from forex and fixed income derivaties.  NIM improved on a sequential quarter basis coming at +14bps better. The quarter-on-quarter improvement in NIM was due to gradual loan re-pricing and average CASA growth which expanded +3.7%yoy to IDR103.5t.  Gross NPL fell - 54bps yoy to 3.41%. Although, there was a marginal increase in gross NPL (by +2bps qoq) as compared to as at 2QFY18, we believe that the general trend is towards overall improvement in asset quality. Meanwhile, corporate, MSME and consumer segments saw gross NPL declined by -130bps yoy, -60bps yoy and -10bps yoy to 1.5%, 2.9% and 2.9% respectively.  Loans expanded +2.2%yoy to IDR182.8t, which slightly off pace from last quarter's +3.0%yoy. However, we understand this was partly due to ongoing realignment of its loans book to reduce exposure in auto, personal and micro loans. These segments fell -32.8%yoy to IDR6.81t, - 12.5%yoy to IDR4.28t and -1.5%yoy to IDR7.69t respectively. Meanwhile, mortgage loans continue to support loans growth as it expanded strongly at +10.0%yoy to IDR29.1t. We make no changes to our forecast pending the Group's 3QFY18 result later this month. We were pleasantly surprised by CIMB Niaga's solid results. In particular was the improvement in NIM and NII. As such, we believe that the drag from the weakness in NII may be less than we initially anticipated. In addition, we were pleased to see continued robust NOII growth and lower provisions, which may provide support to CIMB Niaga's earnings. Therefore, we opine that CIMB Niaga may not be too much of an encumbrance to the Group's earnings, operationally. Any moderating factors to Group earnings will likely come from translation effect. We also opine that the Group's performance in Malaysia will continue to be solid. Hence, we maintain our  recommendation with unchanged   based on pegging its FY19 BVPS to PBV multiple of 1.4x.

Therefore we cut our 2018-20 net earnings estimates, revise our  down to  (1.14x CY19E P/BV) from RM7.50 (1.39x CY19E P/BV) and downgrade CIMB to  from BUY. Key macro issues faced in Indonesia, i.e., the weakening of the Rupiah (13% decline year-to-date), rising interest rates, high oil prices and a twin deficit, have altogether dampened sentiment in the country, which may persist over a longer period (over the next 6 to 9 months) than expected. CIMB Niaga, which accounts for 17% of CIMB Group’s 1H18 pre-tax profit, may see weaker growth and profit contribution (~15% to Group’s PBT) arising from slower loan growth at CIMB Niaga (2Q18: 3% yoy) and inevitable margin pressure. Positively, management’s credit cost guidance for CIMB Niaga remains on track to trend around 150bps in 4Q18 (1H18: 167bps). Our 2018E/19E/20E earnings revisions of -1.2%/-4.4%/-6.2% are premised on a larger degree of NIM compression as we factor in another 7bp decline in 2018 to 2.48% (previous assumption 2.55%), and for 2019-20E, another 10bps decline to 2.45%. These were largely due to the rise in funding pressure from Indonesia, more competitive pricing and the rise in shortterm interbank borrowings (within the Group). Meanwhile, our expectation of loan growth has remained unchanged at 4.1-4.7% in 2018-20E vs. management’s target of 6% for 2018 (at Group), with the Malaysian market expected to grow 8% yoy while Indonesia’s loan growth could be challenging in the corporate and SME space.

Domestic corporates loans which have been slowing since post GE14 with management expects pick up only to occur in 1H19. FY18 home market loan book is expected to be driven by retail, which is growing at 1.5-1.8x the industry. Challenging loans growth is also coming from Indonesia in 4Q18 and into 1H19 undermined by the upcoming Presidential elections (April 2019). As highlighted before Niaga is not participating in the infra and subsidised retail space and with the corporate space slow due to the impending elections, loans for Niaga is expected to be on the low single digit for FY18E. As seen in its recent 3Q18 results, CIMB Thai loan book is doing fine with FY18 loans expected to grow 6-7%. Overall, the management is cautious for 2019 and expect loans to be driven by corporates with retail likely to taper. With the expected slowdown next year, management guided for slower loans (domestic loans to grow 1ppts lower than FY18E). . No change in management’s guidance of 5-10bps group compression, with stable NIM expected from all markets with the exception of Niaga’s which is dragging group FY18E NIM due to the recent spate of rate hikes with further pressure expected (depending on further potential interest rate changes) but likely to face ~5% NIM by year end. On the domestic front, no further hike in interest rates is seen, thus stable NIMs are expected. Management highlighted satisfactory asset quality across the board with credit charge revised from the high 50s to the lower 50s bps.

Management expects Niaga’s credit charge shrinking to 150bps by year end (1H18: 177bps) with Thailand ending at <150bps.  . Management also guided for lower CET1 (1H18: 13%) due to the weak rupiah.

1023, CIMB GROUP HOLDINGS BHD ," Tue, 23 Oct 2018, 9:56 AM ",CIMB Group Holdings Bhd - Income Weakness Will be Moderated by OPEX and Provisions,INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS FORECAST VALUATION AND RECOMMENDATION,". We met with the Group’s CFO yesterday. Below are some of the key take away from our meeting:  The management expect that the situation in Indonesia, particularly in relation to NII, will continue to be challenging for the next 6 to 9 month. This is due to the fact that NIM continue to be compressed resulting from aggressive rate hike by Bank Indonesia. We understand that in Indonesia following a rate hike, deposits are repriced first while there would be significant time lag before loans are repriced. While this NII gap will be moderated by better NOII, OPEX and provisions, we understand that it will not be completely offset.  Also, there would be translational impact due to the weaken rupiah. It was estimated that the weaken rupiah vs. ringgit had caused a negative translation impact of circa RM200m to Group’s topline. We expect that Indonesia will continue to be drag for the Group’s earnings at least until 1HFY19. To put into context, CIMB Niaga contributes circa 15-17% of Group’s PBT. The management also expect that there will be weakness in NOII in Malaysia due to the volatile market condition following the surprise GE14 outcome. This had led to slower market activities from May to June. Recall, NOII declined -6.1%yoy to RM2.37b in 1HFY18. We understand that corporates have delayed fund raising as it seek further clarity on the policy direction of the Government. As such, we believe that there could be some clarity after the announcement of Budget 2019 next week. Hence, we believe that the weakness in NOII in Malaysia will normalise in FY19.  We noted that the Group managed to perform within our expectation in 1HFY18 despite the pressure to income. As such, we believe that there will be moderating factors to offset the weakness in income, namely in the form of lower OPEX and credit cost. Cost management initiatives will be accelerated. Meanwhile, credit cost is expected to come in at lower end of guidance of 55 to 60bps, and may potentially be even lower than expected. This is expected to stem from some recoveries in addition to stable asset quality.  We understand that CIMB Thai’s earnings continue to improve with robust income growth and lower provisions following from asset rebalancing there. Recall, CIMB Thai rebalanced its loans book to shrink its exposure to SMEs there in particularly in the agricultural sector. The higher OPEX growth in 9MFY18 (+10.8%yoy to THB6.02b) was due to hiring of personnel which we indicate as a positive sign.  The management expect that NIM elsewhere will remain flattish when compared to previous period as it has not observed any undue competitions in deposits especially in Malaysia. Therefore, Indonesia will be the main reason for NIM compression in FY18. In terms of asset quality, we echo the management’s expectation in that there will be no undue stress. In fact, we have seen improvements in asset quality in Indonesia.  Recall, the management indicated that the Group will need to make investments in order to not only enhance its digital offerings but also streamline its processes. As such, it expects CI ratio to plateu around the 50% level in the next couple of years. However, we believe that this is necessary as the Group will need to keep up with its peers. In addition, we expect the investments in technology will result in cost savings such as improvement of its branch network, lower personnel cost and lower customer acquisition cost. We believe that it is possible for CI ratio to trend downwards towards the mid-40% level after the completion of its digital initiatives. Nevertheless, we opine that the Group's digital strategy may not have an immediate impact and can only assume that any benefit will be seen only in the medium term, i.e. 3 to 4 year period. We make no changes to our forecast pending the Group's 3QFY18 result next month. While we recognized that the Group may be facing some headwinds in terms of its income this year, we also opine that lower OPEX and provisions will be a moderating factor. In fact, the Group have been performing more or less within our expectations thus far. We believe that some of the headwinds will normalise in FY19 and the Group’s earnings potential remains intact. Therefore, we do not see a reason to change our  recommendation. Our   remains unchanged and is based on pegging its FY19 BVPS to PBV multiple of 1.4x. Source:   - 23 Oct 2018"

1023, CIMB GROUP HOLDINGS BHD ," Mon, 22 Oct 2018, 10:59 AM ",CIMB Group Holdings Berhad - Dragged by Higher Tax,INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS FORECAST VALUATION AND RECOMMENDATION,"CIMB Thai 9MFY18 net profit came in marginally lower by -3.1%yoy to THB537.4m. This was mostly due to higher taxation as profit before tax rose +5.9%yoy. Tax was +41.1%yoy higher to THB199.2m over the period.  For 9MFY18, OPEX grew +10.8%yoy to THB6.02b. The increase in OPEX came from higher employee expenses and others. These expanded +9.6%yoy to THB3.3b and +24.6%yoy to THB1.58b. However, we are not overly concerned by this as the increase was due to expansion.  NII grew +4.4%yoy to THB7.94b due to loans expansion of +4.3%yoy to THB219.9b. Interest income rose +3.2%yoy to THB11.27b while interest expense was flattish with +0.3%yoy to THB3.33b. This was despite NIM coming in -11bps to 3.77% lower on lower yield assets.  Provisions for 9MFY18 fell -10.3%yoy to THB3.33b despite gross NPL remaining the same. Gross NPL was 5.7% as at 3QFY18.  Deposits (inclusive of Bill of Exchanges, Debentures and selected Structured Deposit Products) grew +9.2%yoy to THB231.6b. This resulted in Modified LD to come down to a reasonable 95% from 99.4% as at 3QFY17. We make no changes to our forecast pending the Group's 3QFY18 result next month.  We were also encouraged to see income grew robustly despite NIM compression. As such, we believe that the Group’s business in Thailand continues to be sound, and it seems that Group is expanding there. We do not believe that CIMB Thai will be a drag to the Group's earnings. Furthermore, we believe that the Group will be able to achieve its ROE target for this year with the performance in Malaysia to continue to be solid. Hence, we maintain our  recommendation with unchanged   based on pegging its FY19 BVPS to PBV multiple of 1.4x. Source:   - 22 Oct 2018"

The OPEC and allies agreed in June to boost supply as US President Donald Trump urged producers to offset losses caused by sanctions on Iran and to dampen rising prices. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said OPEC and non-OPEC would pump roughly an extra 1 million barrels per day (bpd) following the June agreement. The OPEC document seen by Reuters adds to signs they have yet to deliver the full amount. OPEC says it is on course to do so, although it hasn’t given a timeframe. (Reuters)  Another two to three interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve will likely put US borrowing costs in “neutral” territory where it is neither stimulating nor restricting economic growth, Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan said. At an event sponsored by the Manhattan Institute, Kaplan said he has not decided yet whether the Fed would need to raise rates above this neutral level. Against solid economic fundamentals, Kaplan said current Fed policy remains “modestly” accommodative. (Reuters)  The ECB will end its negative interest-rate policy in Jan 2020 and start paying for deposits eight months after that, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. Liftoff is predicted for Sept next year, and the deposit rate is seen climbing to 0.25%, from minus 0.4% currently, by the end of 2020. Policymakers took a big step this month toward scaling back unprecedented stimulus, reducing monthly asset purchases to EUR15bn (USD17bn). With the programme set to be capped at EUR2.6trn at year-end, interest rates have moved back to the center of attention. (Bloomberg)  Euro area current account surplus increased in Aug from the previous month, preliminary data from the ECB showed. The current account surplus rose to EUR24bn from EUR19bn in July. A year ago, the surplus was EUR39bn. The visible trade surplus increased to EUR22bn from EUR19bn in the previous month, while the surplus in services trade decreased to EUR9bn from EUR10bn. The balance in the primary income account grew to EUR7bn from EUR9bn, while the shortfall in the second income account narrowed to EUR13bn from EUR14bn. In the 12 months to Aug, the current account surplus was EUR379bn, or 3.3% of Eurozone GDP, versus EUR330bn or 3.0% in the previous 12- month period. (RTT)  China’s economic expansion slowed to its weakest pace since the financial crisis, as top financial regulators launched an extraordinary coordinated effort to calm jittery investors. The rate of growth in 3Q dropped to 6.5%, falling short of market expectations, official statistics showed. Growth in industrial output and consumption weakened in the quarter, while exports held up despite the country’s bruising trade fight with the US. Shortly before the data was released, PBOC Gov. Yi Gang, banking and insurance regulatory chief Guo Shuqing and top securities cop Liu Shiyu all issued statements urging investors to remain calm. (WSJ)  China must balance the need for stable growth while managing risks and maintain a prudent and neutral monetary policy, the State Council, the country’s cabinet, said on Sunday following a meeting of top economic and financial policymakers. Data released on Friday showed the world’s second largest economy growing at its weakest pace since the global financial crisis, underscoring challenges for Beijing amid an escalating trade war with the United States and sluggish domestic demand. (Reuters)  Japan’s most closely watched gauge of inflation edged up again in Sept with the help of costlier energy to tally with Governor Haruhiko Kuroda’s latest view that consumer prices are rising at about half the pace targeted by the central bank. While Kuroda has taken a more bullish view on the current strength in inflation, economists said the latest data offered little beyond the gains in energy and food prices to suggest that inflation can make major progress in the near term. (Bloomberg)  CIMB Thai Bank PCL said its net profit for the 3QFY18 rose 131% to THB177.2m (RM22.6m), from THB76.5m a year earlier, on higher interest income and lower impairment losses. CIMB Thai, owned 94.11% by CIMB Group Holdings, said interest income during the quarter rose 6% to THB3.91bn, from THB3.69bn previously. For the cumulative nine months, net profit fell 4% to THB537.38m, from THB554.38m. Operating income however rose 3% to 10.09bn baht, from 9.84bn baht.

(The Edge)  DutaLand has bagged a RM12.03m contract for the construction of a new extension and upgrading work for the Avenue K shopping mall at Jalan Ampang, Kuala Lumpur. Its wholly-owned unit, Oakland Holdings SB, accepted the letter of award today from City Properties SB. The transaction is a related party one as certain DutaLand directors and major shareholders are deemed to have interests in the transaction. The scope of work entails the construction and maintenance of the extension and upgrading works for levels 3 and 4 of the mall, together with landscape works. (The Edge)  IT company Vortex Consolidated intends to raise up to RM54.89m through a series of corporate exercises that involve a share consolidation, rights issue with warrants, and a right issue of new irredeemable convertible preference shares (ICPS). Vortex plans to consolidate every two existing shares into one, which would result in an adjustment to its share price. For illustration, based on the company’s last transacted market price of 8.5sen per share, the adjusted reference price would be 17sen post-consolidation. (The Edge)  Boustead Holdings, which is being sued together with former Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak and his wife Rosmah Mansor by businessman Deepak Jaikishan over some land deals, said that the purchase consideration of the deals named in the suit were arrived at on a willing-seller, willing-buyer basis. It also said the market value of the plots of freehold land that were acquired by its unit Bakti Wira Development SB which has also been named as a plaintiff in the suit, were appraised by an independent valuer. (The Edge)  MyEG Services (MyEG) says the company has received a confirmation from Malaysia's anti-graft commission that neither the company nor its board of directors are under investigation in relation to the charges brought against former deputy prime minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi. The company is also not a party to the investigation that led to the 45 charges that Zahid was slapped with this morning. It said it has received a letter from the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission confirming and clarifying the above. (The Edge) US benchmarks ended last Friday mixed, though still higher for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3% higher on account of strong earnings from Procter & Gamble which saw its share price jump 8.8% on the day. The S&P 500 was fractionally lower as weakness in healthcare and consumer discretionary stocks offset gains in consumer staples. Corporate earnings continue to be robust however, with 8 of 10 companies reporting better-than-expected numbers thus far. European bourses were mostly lower amid ongoing tensions between the European Commission and Italy with regard to the latter’s budgetary policy obligations. Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC 40 fell 0.3% and 0.6% though UK’s FTSE 100 gained 0.3% despite the impasse in Brexit-related talks. Over in Asia, markets were mostly mixed after China reported a 3Q2018 GDP growth of 6.5% which missed expectations. The Shanghai Composite Index was up 2.6% however after securities regulator unveiled a series of measures to aid the country's struggling stock market, saying it would encourage funds to help ease liquidity difficulties at listed companies, and would support share buy-backs. The Hang Seng Index was up 0.4%. Benchmarks in Singapore and Malaysia slipped 0.2% and 0.3% however.

Notwithstanding that, operating profit improved +16% as allowances for impairments fell 10% to THB3.33b. Topline improved considerably albeit at +3% YoY as NII grew 4% due mainly to significant loans growth (+6%) as NIM fell by 4bps to 4.5%. Nevertheless, topline was dragged by disappointing NOII (-4% YoY) mainly due to falling gains in investments (-78% YoY) and trading & forex (-93% YoY). Asset quality was stable with GIL flattish at 5.7% with credit costs falling 19bps to 2.1%.  after a strong 2Q, earnings fell 7% to THB177m as topline fell (-4%) and higher opex of 10%). Topline (- 4%) was dragged by falling NOII at -28% (from falling gains in investment and trading & forex). Further improvement in loans (+9%) but NIMs fell 18bps to 4.6% from falling yields in assets. Asset quality improved for the quarter as both GIL and credit costs fell by 10bps and 60bps respectively.  While loans showed sign of picking up in 3Q, it came with a price; lower yielding assets (indicating price war) with higher deposit intakes to catch up with credit demand undermining NIM but mitigated by falling impairment allowances. Guidance for mid-single-digit growth for FY18 seems achievable but weak capital markets activities likely to be the theme for 2H18, dragging its topline growth (9M18: <19% vs 9M17: >20%) hence challenging earnings for FY18.  for the Group as historically CIMB Thai’s contribution to the Group is minimal (<5%). 1H18 PBT contribution was at 8%, but we expect to be lower for 9M18 as Group management has guided for better loans, improved NIM and lower credit charge for the other markets namely Malaysia and Indonesia.  For now, pending the Group’s 9M18 results expected at the end of next month, forecast earnings maintained for now. We have previously lowered our FY18E earning by 3.4% to RM4.93b as we slashed our NOII by 19%. We maintain our conservative assumptions of: (i) loans growth of ~5%, (ii) 11bps NIM contraction, and (iii) credit charge of 40-50bps.  based on a PB/PE of 1.0x/12.4x. Note that the target PB of 1.0x is 0.5SD-level below its 5-year mean to reflect the on-going challenges ahead.

Dato’ Sri Nazir has served CIMB for 29 years, since 1989, including as Group CEO for 15 years and as Group Chairman since 2014.  We are neutral on the news and do not believe that it will be negative impact to the Group. This is because the Group could be considered ""institutionalized"" and does not depend on an individual. It had a transition in the position of CEO in 2014 without any detrimental effect.  The Group continues to have solid operations and earnings potential. For example, as at 1HFY18, normalised 1HFY18 net profit grew +3.3%yoy despite net income declining -5.2%yoy as it was moderated lower loan provisions which fell -29.4%yoy to RM746m. Also, since the introduction of its T18 initiative, management have managed to contained OPEX. In 2QFY18, OPEX fell for the second consecutive quarter with -2.5%yoy (vs. -6.8%yoy in 1QFY18). Furthermore, we opine that the Group is on track to achieve its FY18 targets, with possible headwinds in terms of income to be moderated by containment in expenses and credit cost.  We maintain our FY18 and FY19 forecasts.  In our opinion, the fundamentals of the Group remains solid and the recent announcement will not have any negative impact. Earnings growth will be driven by lower OPEX and credit cost, while traction for its loans growth will help to mitigate the pressure on income. We also believe that this could resolve any overhang issue with the stock and may turn investors' sentiment around. At currenct valuation, we believe that the stock is undervalued given its prospects and have lagged its peers recently. Hence, we reiterate our   call with unchanged  based on pegging its FY19 BVPS to a PBV of 1.3x. Also, we believe the expected dividend yield of 4.3% will limit any downside risk.

1023, CIMB GROUP HOLDINGS BHD ," Thu, 30 Aug 2018, 9:53 AM ",CIMB Group Holdings Berhad - Lower Provisions and Cost Discipline Saved the Day,INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS FORECAST VALUATION AND RECOMMENDATION,"The Group 1HFY18 normalised earnings was within expectations and coming in at 47.3% and 52.1% of ours and consensus’ full year estimates respectively. The normalised net profit excluded the CPAM & CPIAM gain of RM928m but included the CSI gain of RM163m.  Normalised 1HFY18 net profit grew +3.3%yoy despite net income declining -5.2%yoy. The income pressure was alleviated by lower loan provisions which fell -29.4%yoy to RM746m. This was due to improvement from consumer (-53.0%yoy to RM261m) and commercial segment (- 34.4%yoy to RM181m). Asset quality was also stable with GIL ratio remaining unchanged from 2QFY17 and 1QFY18 at 3.2%.  OPEX fell for the second consecutive quarter where 2QFY18 OPEX declined -2.5%yoy (vs. -6.8%yoy in 1QFY18). This resulted in 1HFY18 OPEX contracting -7.3%yoy as personnel, establishment, marketing and admin & general expenses declined by -7.0%yoy, -11.9%yoy, -10.1%yoy and -0.4%yoy to RM2.42b, RM974m, RM134m and RM698m respectively. OPEX reduction was due to deconsolidation of CIMB Security International and forex impact. However, excluding forex, OPEX would have fallen -3.0%yoy which we opine showed the positive effect from the management cost management initiatives. There were several factors that affected income in 1HFY18. These are:- (1) NII declined -4.8%yoy due to NIM contraction in Indonesia where it fell by -78bps(yoy) to 5.09%. This resulted in Group 1HFY18 NIM to decline by -19bps(yoy). (2) NII decline was also due to softer commercial and wholesale banking. (3) NOII decline of -6.1%yoy due to slower capital market activity especially from GE14 impact in Malaysia.  Nevertheless, we believe that income weakness could potentially moderate in 2HFY18 as capital market acitivity picked up in 3QFY18. While NIM may continue to be under pressure, the management does not expect NIM to compress further and may be maintained cira 2.45% to 2.5% level. Coupled with continuing gross loans growth, we expect NII in 2HFY18 to recover and moderate the decline in 1HFY18.  Group gross loans as at 2QFY18 grew by +3.4%yoy to RM329.9b driven by the consumer segment. Loans growth in this segment expanded +4.0%yoy to RM171.5b mainly supported by mortgages where it saw expansion in Malaysia (+10.1%yoy), Thailand (+5.7%yoy) and Indonesia (+8.9%yoy). Meanwhile, excluding forex effect, total gross loans grew +7.0%yoy with Malaysia the main contributor at +9.4%yoy. Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore saw loans growth in local currency of +6.3%yoy, +3.0%yoy and +11.0%yoy respectively.  Deposits expanded +1.5%yoy to RM354.0b as at 2QFY18. However, discounting the forex effect, deposits grew +4.7%yoy. Consumer CASA growth was robust in Malaysia and Indonesia, expanding +7.1%yoy and +7.9%yoy respectively. However, CASA declined in Thailand (-27.4%yoy) but we undestand that this was partly deliberate in order to whittle down the expnsive savings deposits.  The Group is proposing an interim dividend of 13 sen or 51.6% payout ratio of reported net profit.  Recall, the management is targeting the following for FY18; (1) ROE of 10.5%, (2) Dividend payout ratio of 40-60%, (3) total loans growth of +6.0%yoy, (4) credit cost of 0.55-0.60%, (5) CET1 ratio of 12.0%, and (6) CI of 50.0%. We opine that the Group is on track to achieve its targets. Loans growth will be supported by the consumer segment in Malaysia, and is expected to pick up with drawdowns from corporate loans. We understand from our previous discussions with the management that the corporates have not cancelled any of its approved loans but merely delaying the drawdown. Possible headwinds will be the weakness in income, but we expect it to moderate in 2HFY18. In addition, the management have indicated that cost will be contained and credit cost is expected to be better than targeted. We make no change to our forecasts. We opine that the Group perform well to mitigate the contraction in income by containing cost and provisions. We believe this will be the key for the Group to achieve its ROE target for this year. Meanwhile, growth have been robust in Malaysia and recovery in Thailand will support the Group’s overall performance. Hence, we are maintaining our  call with unchanged   based on pegging its FY19 BVPS to a PBV of 1.3x. Also, we believe the expected dividend yield of 4.3% will limit any downside risk.

However, after stripping of these gains, CNP accounts for only 43%/45% of our/market estimates. It has also declared an interim DPS of 13.0 sen/share (in line).  6M18 CNP surged ahead by 44% on account of the RM1.1b gains. Top-line was poor, falling by 7% YoY on account of falling NII and NOII (-10% YoY and - 14% YoY respectively) mitigated by surging Islamic banking income (+27% YoY). Abysmal NII was dragged by NIM compression of 30bps (dragged by Niaga) as loans grew by 3.0% (vs. guidance/expectation/systems of +6%/<5%/~4%). Overall broad-based growth seen across the region with Malaysia’s contribution to Group loans rising 3ppt to 60% (with Niaga’s contribution falling 2ppt to 17%). Fall in NOII was due to a weak 2Q (-22% QoQ mainly due to forex losses for the period). On a positive note, asset quality improved slightly as GIL dipped 4bps to 3.2% with credit charge falling 20bps to 0.46% (vs. guidance/expectation of 55-60bps/40-45bps). Although opex fell, CIR remained flattish at 52% (vs. industry’s 48%).   stripping of the gains, CNP fell 23% to RM889m as top-line fell 5%, dragged by NII and NOII (-2% and -22% respectively). Loans continued to show traction at 2% (vs Q1: <1%) but sinking NIM (by 8bps) dragged NII. Further strengthening of asset quality seen as both GIL and credit charge fell 5bps and 7bps, respectively. . Despite uncertainties arising from recent domestic and external geo-political events, CIMB maintained its guidance of; (i) ROE of 10.5%, (ii) strong loans at 6%, (iii) 5-10bps NIM contraction, and (iv) credit charge of 55- 60bps. Its loans target of ~6% is doable on account of robust growth from the domestic front while loans growth is facing challenges in Indonesia (Presidential elections) and Thailand (as the business environment is not conducive). Niaga’s NIMs is still a challenge with the drag in corporate/SME loans to offset its mortgage book, of which the interest spread is a bit low but traction in group’s CASA outpaced other deposits, which should support its NIM target. Domestic capital markets have been slow but management expects it to show improvement in later months of the year supporting its NOII. . We lowered our FY18E earning by 3.4% to RM4.93b as we slashed our NOII by 19%.

In 2Q18, the group NIM was down 7bps qoq to 2.48% (due to upward repricing of domestic deposits and at CIMB Niaga). We expect the NIM to stabilize at around 2.55% (with 5-10bps contraction yoy) as CIMB Niaga will start repricing financing rates in 2H18.

1023, CIMB GROUP HOLDINGS BHD ," Tue, 21 Aug 2018, 9:40 AM ",PublicInvest Research Headlines - 21 Aug 2018,Economy Markets Market Update," A broad cross-section of US businesses has a message for the Trump administration: new tariffs on USD200bn of Chinese imports will force Americans to pay more for items they use throughout their daily lives, from cradles to coffins. Six days of public hearings on the proposed duties of up to 25% will start on Monday in Washington as part of President Donald Trump's and the US Trade Representative's efforts to pressure Beijing for sweeping changes to its trade and economic policies. Unlike previous rounds of US tariffs, which sought to shield consumers by targeting Chinese industrial machinery, electronic components and other intermediate goods, thousands of consumer products could be directly hit with tariffs by late Sept. (Reuters)  Washington's huge fiscal and monetary stimuli will give the world economy an estimated USD600bn shot in the arm this year. That amount represents the difference between the expected US purchases and sales of goods and services in world trade. Technically, you can call it the US current account deficit. Some people may recall that this is exactly the opposite of what President Donald Trump promised in 2015 and has repeated ever since. The data published earlier this month show that Trump is nowhere close to delivering on that promise. In fact, China, Japan and Europe are getting a big piece of his tax cut in their combined trade surplus of USD297.8bn during the first six months of this year. That is an 8.2% increase from what they got out of a more sluggish American economy a year ago. (CNBC)  President Donald Trump does not expect much progress from trade talks with China this week in Washington, he told Reuters. Trump said in an interview that he had ""no time frame"" for ending the trade dispute with China. ""I'm like them, I have a long horizon,"" he added. The talks this week come as new US tariffs on USD16bn of Chinese goods take effect, along with retaliatory tariffs from Beijing on an equal amount of US goods. The US Trade Representative's Office also is holding hearings this week on proposals for tariffs on further USD200bn of Chinese goods. Trump said Chinese negotiators would be arriving shortly, adding he did not ""anticipate much"" from the mid level discussions. (Reuters)  President Donald Trump is grousing again about his Federal Reserve chairman, telling political donors that he was hoping for easier monetary policy. Speaking at a fundraiser in the Hamptons, Trump said he thought Fed Chairman Jerome Powell would favor cheaper money and not have such a heavy hand when it comes to interest rate hikes, which cited three sources who attended the event. The Fed has hiked its benchmark interest rate target five times since Trump took office in Jan 2017, compared with just once for his predecessor, Barack Obama. In addition, the Fed has indicated two more rate hikes before the end of the year and three more in 2019. ""He was questioning why it was happening,"" one person at the event said, according to a Dow Jones report. (CNBC)  Greece's current account balance showed a smaller surplus in June compared to the same month a year earlier on the back of a wider trade deficit. Central bank data showed the surplus fell to EUR210m (USD240.18m) from a surplus of EUR737m in June 2017. Tourism revenues increased to EUR2.33bn from EUR2.007bn in the same month a year earlier. In June the current account was down by EUR527m YoY, as a result of deterioration principally in the balance of goods and to a lesser extent in the primary income account. The trade gap rose by EUR535m as imports outstripped exports, mainly the result of a worsening in the oil balance. In Jan to June, Greece's current account showed a deficit of EUR3.8bn, up by EUR555m YoY as the trade deficit widened. (Reuters)  The Bank of England's Chief Economist Andy Haldane warned on Monday that the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) threatens to replace a huge number of jobs. Haldane said that the so called Fourth Industrial Revolution a digitally-driven paradigm shift similar to previous industrial revolutions in the West, had the potential to displace numerous jobs and leave people ""technologically unemployed."" ""Each of those [industrial revolutions] had a wrenching and lengthy impact on the jobs market, on the lives and livelihoods of large swathes of society,"" Haldane told the BBC. The BOE economist cautioned that previous industrial revolutions resulted in ""heightened social tensions,"" ""financial tensions"" and ""inequality."" (CNBC)  State-run oil company Sinopec is selling diesel as far afield as South Africa as China’s refiners seek homes for their surplus fuel in the latest sign of troubles in the domestic refining business. Sinopec said on Monday it shipped its first 30,000 tonnes of diesel from its Shanghai refinery heading for South Africa. This cargo and another Sept shipment marked the first batch to South Africa in two years. Such shipments have also been extremely rare in the past five years. China’s four oil majors are facing a glut overhang in domestic market and the companies are fully aware of the headwinds ahead. China exported record volumes of diesel in May, with the total almost hitting 2.4m tonnes. Shipments have remained firm since, as domestic fuel demand growth stagnates.

In addition, the purchased shares may be held as treasury shares and resold on Bursa Malaysia, with the intention of realising a potential gain without affecting the total issued shares of the company. The proposed share buy-back is expected to be completed by the 4Q of 2018, it added. (The Edge)  Petronas Dagangan (PetDag), the marketing arm of Petroliam Nasional, saw its net profit rise 27.8% to RM314.4m in the 2QFY18 from RM246.0m a year ago, mainly due to higher margin which resulted from increasing Mean of Platts Singapore (MOPS) price trend, lower product and freight costs, as well as an increase in other income arising from insurance proceeds claim received by a subsidiary. This was partially offset by higher advertising and promotion expenses. The group also declared an interim dividend of 16 sen per share for the FYE Dec 31, 2018, payable on Sept 19.

It attributed the weak quarterly revenue to a decrease in its plantations business due to lower palm kernel (PK) price in the Malaysian operations by 24.9%, and lower crude palm oil (CPO) and PK prices in the Indonesian operations by 19.4% and 23.4% respectively, in 2QFY18. (The Edge)  The production of Perodua’s best-selling car model, the new Myvi, has been temporarily halted due to a supply disruption at one of its vendors.

CNP was weak at 2%, supported by falling opex and impairment allowances of 2% and 11%, respectively, as top-line softened.

While management is still hopeful of achieving its loan target of mid- single-digit and NIMs of ~5%, we find this challenging with incoming external and domestic headwinds. Downside risks to loans growth are becoming clear with additional impact coming from the protracted trade war and concerns of slowdown from the emerging markets adding to the stifling loans due the approaching presidential election in April 2019. Further downside pressure on NIM is expected despite the expected additional rate hikes in the later part of the year as repricing of deposits are concurrent with the rate hike with the added concern of re-pricing loans to customers stifling loans and adding risks of further deterioration in asset quality. as we wait for its 6M18 results expected end of the month.

These grew +57.9%yoy, +193.3%yoy and +22.7%yoy to IDR390b, IDR88b and IDR81b respectively.  NIM fell another -7bps qoq. The NIM pressure stemmed from the rate hike by Bank Indonesia.

1023, CIMB GROUP HOLDINGS BHD ," Thu, 26 Jul 2018, 5:23 PM ",CIMB Group - Potential Earnings Risk Priced In,WHAT’S NEW,"The increase in capital market volatility coupled with the challenging NIM environment in Indonesia could weigh on CIMB Group’s (CIMB) noninterest income (non-II) and NIM outlook in 2Q18 and for the year. However, management indicated that a pick-up in consumer loan growth in Malaysia (mainly mortgages), lower- than-expected net credit costs across its key markets and solid operating cost discipline could partially offset the weakness in non-II and NIM. As such, management has indicated that despite the challenging non-II outlook, its full-year ROE target of 10.5% remains within reach.  The heightened capital market volatility and risk aversion post GE14 coupled with external developments has placed pressure on the group’s treasury, investment banking and brokerage income. Bond origination deal flows were also impacted post GE14 as most corporates are taking a wait-and-see approach to the new government’s policy changes. That said, management did indicate that origination flows from the bond market have improved in July but remain below pre-GE14 run rates. Given this development, we have taken a more conservative view and trim our non-II forecast further to incorporate a 1.5% contraction in 2018 and a mild 3% recovery in 2019 (previously 4.2% and 4.9% respectively). Our current non-II forecasts for 2Q-4Q18 imply a 5% decline vs the quarterly run rate in 2H17 when capital markets were relatively robust then. . Post our earnings revision, we now forecast 2018 ROE of 9.8% which is below management’s 10.5% target and consensus’ 10.4% forecast. Given that management has retained its 10.5% ROE for 2018, we think current valuations at 1.05x 2018F P/B and 2019F P/B have largely priced in potential downside risk to earnings. This is also in our latest earnings forecasts which are 4% below consensus. Management has retained its group loan growth target of 6.0% in 2018 despite slowerthan-expected growth from CIMB Niaga. Strong consumer growth in Malaysia coupled with a recovery in loan growth in Thailand and Singapore should be sufficient to offset the expected softness in loan growth form CIMB Niaga. The weakness in loan growth from CIMB Niaga is partly attributed to the slower-than-expected roll-out of infrastructurerelated projects due to uncertainty from the impending presidential elections in Sep 18. In terms of loan growth by key market, we expect Malaysia to deliver a commendable 6-7% growth, 5-6% for Singapore and Thailand, and 2-3% for Indonesia The group is expected to report various one-off disposal and revaluation gains in 2018.

Recall that the group was considering partially utilising the buffers from the various one-off gains for a number of restructuring exercises that could help enhance future productivity and reduce operating cost. However, management said greater clarity of such rationalisation measures may only be announced towards 4Q18 as it sets its new 5-year plan (2019-23). As such, any potential catalysts from the announcement of such measures may only take effect from 2H19. As part of its medium-term targets, management has alluded to: a) stronger growth in Indonesia, b) increase digitisation adoption; and c) further cost rationalisation to help drive group ROE closer towards the 13.0%. Management has retained its 55-60bp credit cost target for 2018 but improving asset quality outlook across all its key markets suggests that 2018 net credit cost may come in at the lower end of the targeted range or lower. This assumes the ongoing trade tensions between the US and China does not worsen and become a full blown trade war. If so, there is upside risk to the group’s expected loss provision requirement under FRS9. Post GE14, the slowdown in corporate loan growth has not translated into a deterioration in asset quality relating to the cancellation of construction projects. As such, we continue to project an improvement in the group’s net credit cost from 76bp in 2017 to 54bp in 2018 driven mainly by a continued improvement in CIMB Niaga’s net credit cost from 226bp in 2017 to 155bp in 2018. Taking a more conservative view, we reduce our 2018-19 net profit forecasts by 7% and 8% respectively as we factor in the impact of heightened capital market volatility and higher-than-expected NIM pressure at CIMB Niaga on the group’s non-II growth and NIM. Post our earnings adjustments, we now forecast NIM to fall by 8bp for 2018 and 1.5% in 2018 but grow 3% in 2019 (previously -6bp, +4.2% and +4.9% respectively). Post earnings adjustment, we cut our (1.23x 2018F P/B, 9.8% ROE). Despite the potential risk of a slower domestic corporate loan growth and weaker near-term investment banking income outlook, given the heightened capital market volatility, we think current valuations at below -1SD to its long-term mean PE and P/B have priced in the above-earnings risks. We continue to project a commendable net profit growth of 7.4% for 2018, driven by a downward normalisation in credit cost to 54bp vs 2017’s 76bp. The stock continues to trade at an attractive 11.0x 2018F PE (five-year historical mean of 13.3x) and 1.05x 2018F P/B (historical mean of 1.20x). Source:   - 26 Jul 2018"

Downside risk should be capped by sound domestic operations (69-70% of group pre-tax profit). Management believes that chances of CIMB achieving its loan growth target of 6% (at Group level) remain good due to a better outlook in Malaysia (might even exceed target on potential pick-up in corporates, SMEs and mortgages). Loan growth in Singapore is also picking up while the environment remains challenging in Thailand and Indonesia due to upcoming elections. Management's mid single-digit target for Indonesia may be challenged due to a lack of demand in the corporate and SME space though retail loans (mortgages) are growing at a high single-digit. We expect group level provisions to ease qoq and yoy. Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand are likely to have performed better in 2Q18 – no new major accounts became NPLs while some recoveries are expected. CIMB Niaga’s credit cost was tracking down towards the 150bps level in 2Q18 (1Q18: 179bps). Management maintained its credit cost guidance of 55-60bps. Management maintained its guidance for a 5-10bps contraction in the NIM for 2018 (vs. 2.63% in 2017), driven by CIMB Niaga’s weaker NIM outlook (potentially down 50bps to c.5% in 2018), while the outlook is expected to be steady in Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore. Non-interest income may have seen some pressure from a shortfall from fixed income activities, but this may be temporary owing to the slowdown in capital markets in 2Q18. Maintain BUY. Our Price Target remains unchanged at RM7.50 based on a 1.38x P/BV target on CY19E BVPS (underlying assumptions: 2019E 9.8% ROE, 8.4% cost of equity). For 2018E, our key assumptions include loan growth at 4% yoy, NIM at 2.55%, credit cost at 57bps and a CIR of 49%. Downside risks – further deterioration in asset quality, NIM pressure.

1023, CIMB GROUP HOLDINGS BHD ," Thu, 26 Jul 2018, 8:56 AM ",CIMB Group Holdings - Challenges Coming from Indonesia,," Management expects its loans target of ~6% to be doable on account of robust growth from the domestic front while loans growth is facing challenges in Indonesia and Thailand. The impending Presidential campaign is stifling loans growth in Indonesia with demand lacking from both corporates & SMEs while infra loans are coming down. Retail loans ex- auto are growing but face competitive challenge in retaining them and we expect Niaga’s FY18E loan target of mid-single-digit challenging. As for Thailand, growing loans is still challenging as the business environment is not conducive albeit satisfactory asset quality.  . On the domestic front, retail loans (especially from mortgages) are resilient with corporates loans sliding and slower drawdown from corporate sector arising from the uncertainties of the business environment post GE14. Management is positive on clarity emerging by 4Q18, with pickups in corporate loan/drawdown and expects domestic loans surpassing domestic systems loans growth (1Q18: loans were at +8% vs. system loans of +4%). . No change in management’s guidance of 5-10bps compression, with stable NIM expected from all markets with the exception of Indonesia which is expected to drag the overall group FY18E NIM. Indonesia is still facing downside pressure and likely to face a ~5% NIM as expected. On the domestic front, no further hike in interest rates is seen, thus stable NIMs are expected. However, management did highlight challenges of growing CASA domestically and is still pushing to grow CASA in Indonesia. Another factor that dragging NIM in Indonesia is the drag in corporate/SME loans to offset its mortgage book, which interest spread is low.    Management highlighted satisfactory asset quality across the board and maintains its group guidance of 55-60bps with Indonesia trending closer to 150bps overall (1Q18: 190bps). Management highlighted of potential higher side of group credit costs guidance to take into account of the expected loss calculations under the MFRS9 accounting due to the on-going trade friction globally. While management expects its FY18E ROE target of 10.5% is achievable, we do find further downside risks as management highlighted further risks coming from flattish NOII as domestic capital markets have been slow but are expected to show improvement in later months of the year. Our FY18E earnings estimate is kept unchanged at RM5.1b, as we render existing assumptions to be conservative enough. Our FY18E assumptions are; (i) ROE at 10% (ii) Loans at 5% (iii) Credit cost of 58-60bps, and (iv) NIMs compression of 10bps.  based on a FY19E PB/PE of 1.0x/12.4x.

Total Income of THB6.6b performed better (+7% YoY) underpinned by: (i) +5% YoY growth in net interest income (NII), and ii) +15% YoY growth in Non-Interest Income (NOII) to THB1.4b. The strong NOII was driven by 10% improvement in Net Fee & Service Income to THB988m and gains on financial liabilities of THB355b. Loans were still disappointing, continuing its flattish trajectory (vs. 2Q17: +0.5% YoY) with the positive upside in NII driven by improvement in Net Interest margin (NIM) by 10bps to 3.9%. Higher deterioration in asset quality (attributed to commercial banking loans) drove Gross Impaired Loans (GIL) higher by 40bps to 5.8% but credit charge remained flat at 2.3%.  despite Core Net Profit (CNP) performing better by +13% to THB191m partly due to a lower tax rate of 23% vs. 1Q18: 38%.

As expected, credit charge and NIMs have improved (within our expectations of NIM: ~4% and credit charge <2.3%) and we expect stable NIMs supported by moderate credit demand ahead.

Sources say Nazir has informed the CIMB board of directors that he will not be seeking a re-election as the chairman of the banking group and will leave when his term finishes next August. While there is talk that Nazir could leave earlier than August, the source says so far, there has been no indication of him being “told to go”. “He has not been called in by the Council of Eminent Persons (CEP) or anyone else,” says the source. Tun Daim Zainuddin has said that it is entirely up to Dato Seri Nazir Razak if he chooses to retire early or to see through his contract terms (Source: The Star) Datuk Nazir Razak’s potential resignation or intention not to seek re-election as Chairman is unlikely to affect the group’s operations as we believe that Datuk Seri Nazir Razak’s role may be more of a consultative role on large decision-making processes. The group’s operations and strategy planning are largely spearheaded by the CEO (Dato’ Sri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz), CFO (Shahnaz Jammal) and its management team, which also includes the likes of Renzo Veigas and Thomas Meow (advisors to Group CEO office). In addition, Datuk Seri Nazir Razak’s stake in CIMB Group Bhd is only 0.47% and as such will not cause a share overhang if he were to sell down his stake. His exit may also pave the way for investors’ perception of a more institutionalised and professionally managed CIMB.

1023, CIMB GROUP HOLDINGS BHD ," Mon, 11 Jun 2018, 10:25 AM ",Banking - 1Q18 results roundup: Positivity continues,Profitability Lending indicator Asset quality,"CY1Q18 was a decent quarter for most banks (except for AMMB, which missed our expectations). Net profit increased at stronger pace of 10.4% YoY in 1Q18 (vs. 5.2% YoY in 4Q17), supported by (i) higher NII arising from a 25 bps OPR hike in Jan-18, and (ii) flattish overheads (due to deconsolidation of CIMB brokerage expenses to CSI). Loan growth was muted as strengthening Ringgit against major currencies contributed to the subdued loan growth. Banks shored up liquidity position, led to improving CASA ratio. Capital remains intact despite moderation in the Tier 1 and core capital as a result of implementation of MFRS9. We reiterate our 2018 loan growth target at 5-5.5%. Maintain OVERWEIGHT. Top picks: RHB (TP: RM6.00) and Maybank (TP: RM11.00). Banks under our coverage posted firmer 1Q18 results, with total net profit (recorded by the 8 banks under our coverage) rising by 0.9% QoQ and 10.4% YoY to RM6.5bn. During the quarter, 7 out of 8 banks came in within our expectation, while AMMB’s results disappointed (see Figure #1). Net profit for the sector rose 10.4% YoY to RM6.5bn in 1Q18, supported by (i) higher NII of RM13.9bn (2.6% YoY, arising from a 25bps OPR hike in Jan-18, which has in turn resulted in NIM expansion) and (ii) flattish overhead expenses (0% YoY). AMMB and Alliance’s net profits eased by 24.5% and 3.8%. This was derailed by (i) higher operating expenses incurred and (ii) normalising of loan-loss-provision due to lack of recoveries (for AMMB’s case), and (iii) pick up in overhead expenses related to certain products investment incurred for Alliance. Other banks recorded double-digit earnings growth (Affin: +18.5%; BIMB: +13.8%; CIMB: +10.6%; Maybank: +10%, Public Bank: +12.6%; and RHB: +18.1% YoY), thanks to i) higher NOII (ii) positive JAWS and (iii) stable credit cost Overall, overhead expenses remained flattish during the quarter and this was driven mainly by deconsolidation of CSI expenses from CIMB’s balance sheet. Nevertheless, we witnessed several banks (in particularly, RHB and Alliance) expanding their overhead expenses related to investment in products. NOII was decent at RM5.1bn (+6% YoY). This was supported by higher other NOII namely trading income and sale of investment securities, driven from favourable forex movement. RHB posted stronger NOII due to one-off gain investment in Private Equity company whilst Public Bank continued to be supported by its unit trust division. On QoQ, NOII was disappointed (-5.6%) as the deconsolidation of brokerage income from the disposal of 50% stake in CSI. Driven by 25bps OPR hike in Jan-18, NIM grew 2bps YoY to 2.29% benefiting from 25bps OPR hike in Jan-18. For Affin, NIM expanded 2bps YoY driven from improving CASA ratio, however NIM decreased 7bps QoQ as Affin was growing its expensive deposits, to comply with NSFR requirement. We expect NIM to normalise in coming quarters, when re-pricing of longer term fixed deposits kick in. During the quarter, Alliance experienced the largest NIM increment (by 16bps YoY to 2.41%), attributed to the OPR hike and higher loan yield assets in its loan portfolio. Loan growth picked up marginally by 3.1% YoY (vs. 3% YoY in 4Q17). Having experienced loan contraction for the last 2 consecutive quarters, Alliance finally posted a positive growth (2.5 YoY), thanks to improvement in high RAR loan which grew 19.3% YoY. CIMB and Maybank posted subdued loan growth of 0.5% YoY and 1.5% YoY respectively, as the strengthening Ringgit against the others currencies contributed to the subdued loan growth. Nevertheless, both domestic loan growth rose healthy of 7.9% and 6.7% respectively. Alliance introduced more aggressive loan growth guidance of 10% YoY (for FY19) whilst other banks shared more conservative outlook (with loan growth target of 5- 6%). Alliance loan growth target is banking on latest initiatives, namely Alliance One Account and Alliance@Work that gaining traction from its customers. Customer deposits grew on a firmer note on YoY and QoQ basis as bank shored up their liquidity positions before GE14. Customer deposits rose 1.7% QoQ and 2.6% YoY. Except for Alliance (which reduced its expensive deposit positions in order to improve NIM), most banks posted higher customer deposits growth, and this has in turn resulted in better CASA position. Credit cost deteriorated by 5bps YoY as the deterioration was weighed by provision of lumpy accounts. The deterioration in credit cost was derailed by Maybank (-20bps) and Alliance (-9bps), whilst Affin and AMMB reversed to the net recovery position. Asset quality deteriorated marginally to 1.83% from 1.78% in 4Q17. Among the banks, we note that Alliance posted the sharpest increase in GIL ratio (which increased by 25 bps QoQ to 1.43%) due to hire purchase and non-residential accounts. Nevertheless, we believe that the increase in the Alliance GIL is temporary before it heads back to its normalised level. Affin, CIMB, Maybank and RHB reported the new accounting standard (MFRS 9) for the first time. It was a mixed impact for each bank, of which some of the banks have positive impact to capital as opposed to the guidance given. MFRS9 negatively impact capital ratio for CIMB, Maybank, RHB whilst Public saw its CET1 increased by 20bps. Alliance and AMMB will be reporting MFRS9 starting in Jun-18 results, which both guided muted impact to their CET1 ratios. We also witness, LLC improved as a result of the implementation of MFRS9 as provision levels trending higher. Maintain  . The change of ruling government during GE14 poses uncertainties to the implementation of mega infrastructure projects which could pose a risk to business loan growth. Nevertheless, we are positive that HH loan could fill the slack as certain segments in the HH are set to benefit from the tax holiday period. In addition, new ruling government’s manifesto could assist HH loan such as (i) increase in minimum wages, (ii) introduction of more RTO scheme (iii) lower excise duty for <1500cc vehicles. We view that the banking sector is poised to record a better year in 2018 due to (i) improving ROE (led from recovery of earnings); (ii) improving NOII income; (iii) stable asset quality; and (iv) less severe of MFRS 9 impact.

The sector’s 1Q18 net profit was within our expectation, accounting for 24.5% of our 2018 projection of RM26.4bn. During the quarter, we have bumped up earnings forecasts for Alliance Bank for FY19E (+8.2%) while the rest of the banks’ forecasts are unchanged. The notable upgrade was on CIMB ( ) due to its steep discount. 1Q18 fund-based income (+2.3% yoy; +0.5% qoq) has remained the major earnings driver (despite subdued loan growth of 2.3% yoy), generating an average 74% of bank’s total net income. On average, the sector saw a +4bps yoy expansion in 1Q18 NIM to 2.28% (comprising largely domestic operations) on the back of a 25bps OPR hike and steady domestic loan pricing. Meanwhile, there was no spike in significant NPL accounts, as implied by a steady gross NPL ratio of 1.57% end-Mar18 and easing in sector credit cost (-4bps yoy) in 1Q18. Operating expenses remained relatively sticky against the recent quarters. Maintain  We foresee sector core earnings growth of 6.6% yoy in 2018E, followed by a more modest 4.3% yoy in 2019E and 4.0% yoy in 2020E.

Hong Leong Bank (HLBK MK,   @ 1.57x CY19E P/BV) is poised for stronger performance as it leverages on ample balance sheet liquidity coupled with recovery in BOCD’s earnings.

Out of 148 stocks under our core coverage, 56 of them delivered weaker-than-expected results, implying a “disappointment ratio” of 37.8%, vis-à-vis 32.2% in 4QCY17. On a YoY basis, the ratio also deteriorated significantly from 22.6% in 1Q17. On the other end, merely 10.8% of the stocks under coverage (or 16 stocks) outperformed our expectations in this reporting season (vs. 18.1% and 13.4% seen in 4Q17 and 1Q17 respectively).  ( sectors had shown noticeable signs of weakness while  as well as also showed more disappointments. On another extreme, while there is no outright outperformer, we notice that Banking & Non-Bank Financials sectors had delivered more positive surprises. Other sectors are largely mixed or neutral in nature (see Figure 8). As for the Top Picks selected in early of this quarter (pre-GE14), MBMR was proven to be an outstanding performer. TENAGA also saw a fairly good start as well. In fact, we have upgraded our target price for TENAGA as we roll over our valuation baseyear to CY19. AIRASIA, BIMB, CMMT, HEIM, MQREIT and WCT also managed to deliver decent results. Nonetheless, we have downgraded rating for both CMMT and MQREIT as their share prices had been performing well. Post results, we have also revised down Target Prices for AIRASIA, BIMB, HEIM and WCT on various reasons (despite maintaining their Outperform ratings). PPB, SEM and TM, on other extreme, delivered weaker sets of results (see Figure 8).  Post results, we saw negative earnings revisions of 8.6%/3.9% for FY18E/FY19E, on average, for stocks under our coverage. These earnings revisions are much larger in contrast to FBMKLCI constituents. We believe this could be the driving force behind the recent de-rating of small-and-mid-cap stocks (even before the post GE14 price corrections). Based on our FBMKLCI earnings universe,  (from 6.1%/6.0% previously) due mainly to earnings downgrades in (i) Plantations, (ii) Telco as well as sectors (see Figure 9). Note that, post revisions, our estimates are not far from the  (vs. 5.7%/7.3% previously). However, note that, our estimate earnings growth rates could be higher, say 6.7%/7.1% for FY18E/FY19E, should DIALOG, HARTA and MAHB to be included into the list of constituents of FBMKLCI (to replace AMBANK, ASTRO and YTL).  we have also revised  (from 1,950 previously), representing FY18E/FY19E PER of 16.3x/15.5x. Our Index Target is derived via the average of the followings:-   Market overcorrected? The local equity benchmark index, FBMKLCI, tested its 52-week low of ~1,708 of late due to concerns over the fiscal and national debt positions. The month of May had seen a strong outflow of foreign capital (amounting to RM5.6b) from the local equity market. The volatility of the local market is somewhat not surprising. Recall that in our 2Q18 Investment Strategy Report dated 3 April 2018, we highlighted that 2Q18 is likely to be a weaker yet volatile quarter. Apart from facing uncertainty over GE14, we also suspect trading volume or market interest could be lacklustre due to the Muslim fasting month and FIFA World Cup 2018 around the corner. Nonetheless, the recent sell-down was somewhat heavier than expected. FBMKLCI is now trading at a discount of ~10% against the consensus index target of ~1,940, which is way below the -2SD-level of its 3-year mean level of 4.7% discount (see Figure 10). As such, we reckon that the underlying market’s over-reaction presents buying opportunities. For investors who wish to position for a “Mean Reversion” strategy, levels below 1,765 offer excellent reward-to-risk. We believe a reversion back to the mean, implying 1850-level, is highly probable. Based on our Monte Carlo Simulation Study, with 68% confidence interval or the near-equilibrium range, FBMKLCI is like to oscillate between 1,670 and 1,875 with higher probability at the top end (see Figure 11). In fact, technically speaking, the FBMKLCI has yet to violate its long-term uptrend convincingly. From a technical perspective, the FBMKLCI is proven resilient as it still stands firmly above the long-term uptrend channel support line. For the immediate term, FBMKLCI is poised to swing upwards to close a gap between 1,760 and 1,770. Over a slightly longer-period, we are not surprise to see the index reverting back to 1,825, which is the long-term mean since 3Q15 (see Figure 12).  In terms of stock picks, we believe some of the heavily bashed down stocks, especially those that still delivered good numbers are worth considering. For instance, the recent sell-down in banking stocks such as  and   offer good value. We also see more value buys in the construction space. Name like s one of them.    also seen strong sell-down with the change of government. We reckon that the ICPT framework is an efficient and transparent mechanism. Hence, it is likely to be kept. As for YTLPOWR, while its earnings outlook remains challenging in the immediate term before its two new green-field projects come on-stream after 2020, the selling could be overdone with a YTD decline of >40% probably because the YTL Group is one of the consortium members building the KL-Singapore High-Speed Rail (HSR) which is now being scrapped by the new government. Based on our estimate, its Wessex Water minus the group’s net debt is already worth RM0.83/share. While Gaming stocks have seen a fast recovery in their share prices, we still believe  has more legs to go as we believe the earnings recovery of   is sustainable and the GITP expansion program is also starting to bear fruit. Despite having a Neutral-to-Cautious view on the property sector, we do see value emerging as valuations for most property stocks are reaching, if not already touched, their trough levels. Among stocks under our coverage, we prefer  and  for their deep values (coupled with their earnings/sales trajectories) and extremely bashed-down share prices. Last but not least, attention should also be given to retail-related industries. Auto players such as  should benefit from stronger car sales in 3Q18 (i.e. post GST abolishment but prior to reintroduction of SST).

1023, CIMB GROUP HOLDINGS BHD ," Mon, 4 Jun 2018, 9:36 AM ",1Q 2018 Result Round-Up - Notable Weaknesses,,"By all counts, the current quarter’s reporting is somewhat of a letdown. While we had mentioned that the previous 4QCY17 session was a disappointing one, though not likely systemic in nature, ongoing weaknesses are starting to cast doubts. Positive surprises were not forthcoming as the country’s healthy economic growth in 2017 failed to cascade noticeably into corporate and consumer Malaysia more strongly. The commodities-related sectors of oil and gas and plantations provided the bulk of misses this round, with manufacturing also disappointing us and consensus alike, indicating that these misses are not isolated cases The current quarter’s earnings hits (above and/or in-line) are at 60%:40%, similar to the 60%:40% as at 4QCY17 though the make-up is markedly different. With most of the current misses cost-related and showing no signs of abating, we are consequently lowering expectations on account of these yet again. Of some encouragement, if any, is that sales trends for most remain intact albeit muted. Somewhat deflating however is the absence of necessary upward revisions as compared to previous quarters while the opposite is occurring for downward adjustments, early signs of earnings stress.  While it was the larger-capitalized stocks which managed to hold fort earnings-wise in the previous reporting period, the current installment saw weakness from big and small alike. Index-based names like IOI Corporation, KL Kepong, Axiata Group and Telekom Malaysia, just to name a few, missed our and consensus estimates, with earnings of some correspondingly lowered. Reaction on the first trading day post-result reporting has been inconsequential however. The broader market is currently more pre-occupied with a post-General Election re-boot of the country. Sentiment has taken a recent knock, in part due to regional weakness on geopolitical and trade-related concerns, but just as likely due to the relatively negative news flows with regard to the nation’s finances which may or may not have spooked foreign-based investors that sparked a sell-down. We certainly are wary of global developments, but think challenges may only manifest in late-2019 or 2020 at the earliest with the world struggling under a weight of debt amid heightened interest rates, sterilization of excess liquidity from within the financial system and peak-ish economic growth cycles. In the nearer term however (2018), ongoing stability in international trade should help sustain economic expansions. That said, a full-blown trade spat between the US and the rest of the world and/or a political-related meltdown in Europe may advance the timeline. Consequently, our year-end 2018 index target is   points (from 1,860 points) in light of the various changes to earnings, though still tagged to a 16x multiple to earnings. We are retaining our PE multiple however, as our positive view on the market remains unchanged despite recent wobbles. We continue to see value in the small- and mid-cap space, and retain   in our 2018 suggested portfolio. Chin Hin Group and TRC Synergy are dropped given the less sanguine outlook on construction-related stocks. Also,   is removed due to its inability to manage and fully pass on rising feedstock costs.

1023, CIMB GROUP HOLDINGS BHD ," Thu, 31 May 2018, 5:04 PM ",CIMB - On Track Thus Far,INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS FORECAST VALUATION AND RECOMMENDATION," The Group posted 1QFY18 earnings growth of +10.6%yoy. However, this was within expectations as it came in at 22.9% and 28.8% of ours and consensus' expectations respectively. The drivers for the Group's earnings growth were lower OPEX and provisions.  OPEX fell - 6.8%yoy improving CI ratio to 49.8% from 52.6% in 1QFY17. Personnel, establishment, marketing and admin & general expenses declined by -2.4%yoy, -16.4%yoy, -12.1%yoy and -5.6%yoy to RM1.25b, RM485m, RM58m and RM352m respectively. Besides the overall cost management efforts, deconsolidation of CIMB Security International (CSI) also resulted in cost reduction. Recall, the Group sold 50% of its stake in CSI to China Galaxy. Lower loan provisions main contributor to lower provisions.  Asset quality was also stable with GIL ratio at 3.2%.  NII fell -3.5%yoy due to the combination of NIM compression in Indonesia and flattish gross loans growth of +0.5%yoy to RM323.1b. However, the OPR hike in Malaysia had led to a sequential quarter improvement in NIM by +4bps qoq. In addition, we understand that the slower loans growth was due to forex effect as normalised gross loans grew +5.3%yoy with Malaysia especially registering strong growth of +7.9%yoy to RM195.2b. It was mainly contributed by mortgages which expanded +10.7%yoy.  For 1QFY18, NOII grew +3.8%yoy. This included the gain from the CSI stake sale of RM152m. Discounting one-off gains in 1QFY17 and 1QFY18, NOII would have declined by -8.0%yoy to RM1.14b. However, this was due to unrealised losses from financial assets at FVTPL of RM388.5m.  Deposits expanded +2.7%yoy to RM363.4b as at 1QFY18. More notably was CASA growth of only +2.2%yoy to RM127.3b. However, this was also due to forex effect as normalised CASA grew +7.4%yoy, +9.0%yoy and +2.3%yoy in Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore respectively. In addition, CASA growth was impacted by whittling down of expnsive savings deposits in Thailand.  As stated previously, we believe that the Group's capital position is sufficiently buffered for the implementation of MFRS 9 where it stood at 12.2% as at 4QFY17. This allowed the Group to absorb the impact of CET1 ratio reducing by -70bps on Day One implementation. Moreover, its CET1 ratio have since recovered to 11.7% as at 1QFY18 and on track to achieve its target of 12% by end FY18.  Recall, the management is targeting the following for FY18; (1) ROE of 10.5%, (2) Dividend payout ratio of 40-60%, (3) total loans growth of +6.0%yoy, (4) credit cost of 0.55-0.60%, (5) CET1 ratio of 12.0% and (6) CI of 50.0%. Besides the dividend payout ratio, the Group seems to be on track to achieve its targets with the exception of loans growth. However, we understand that the management are expecting loans growth to pick up with corporate loans pipeline looking healthy especially in Indonesia. In addition, we expect loans growth to continue to be robust in Malaysia driven by the consumer segment. We make no change to our forecast.  Notable highlights were the containment of cost and strong NOII. Only disappointment was the NII decline but this was due to the NIM compression in Indonesia. We expect any headwind will come from the competition there. However, we believe that the growth in Malaysia and recovery in Thailand will moderate its impact. Loans growth appears strong and will likely continue in the coming quarters. Hence, we are maintaining our  call with an adjusted  (from RM7.80) as we roll over our valuation to FY19. Our TP is based on pegging its FY19 BVPS to a PBV of 1.4x. Although, the share price have suffered lately due to the uncertainty following the installation of a new Government in Malaysia, we believe that this presents an opportunity for investors. We believe that the share price will recover after dust has settled and more certainty on the policies of the new Government. Source:   - 31 May 2018"

However, stripping out the RM152m gains from the disposal of China Galaxy, CNP would have fallen by 2%. Top-line was abysmal, falling by 5%, dragged by fund and fee-based income with both falling 8% each. Islamic banking income growth of +25% is within our expectation. Abysmal fund-based income was dragged by muted loans growth (+0.5% vs +6% target) and compressing NIM (by 30bps vs 5-10bps compression) mainly due to contraction from Indonesia as well as weak Singapore and Thailand markets. Slight uptick in GIL by 5bps to 3.2% but credit charge at 49bps was within expectation and below guidance. Although opex fell, CIR of 52% is above target/estimate of ~50%.  CNP improved by 23% due to the recognition of the abovementioned disposal. Stripping the one-off gain, CNP would have been at +9%. Nevertheless, the improvement in CNP was attributed to falling opex and impairment allowances (at 7% and 37%, respectively) as top-line declined by 7%. Falling top-line was broad-based with fund and fee-based income declining by 4% and 15%, respectively, with Islamic income falling by 4%.

The positive NIM expansion of 4bps qoq in 1Q18 to 2.57% may not hold in the coming quarters due to margin pressure from Indonesia, though the 25bps rate hike announced on 30 May18 may provide some relief. Meanwhile, the stronger 1Q18 pre-tax profit of RM1.74bn (+8% yoy; +13.5% qoq) was driven by lower impaired loan allowances, with net credit cost down to 49bps from 52bps in 1Q17 and 71bps in 4Q17. The adoption of MFRS 9 had a manageable impact of -70bps on the CET1 ratio on Day-1 (down from 12.2% in Dec17 to 11.5% on 1 Jan18), but it has edged up to 11.7% by 31 Mar18. We upgrade CIMB from a HOLD to BUY, as the stock is currently trading at a steep 21% discount to our revised Price Target of RM7.50 (from RM7.30, based on an unchanged P/BV target of 1.38x on the CY19E BVPS (rolled forward from CY18E; underlying assumptions for 2019 of 9.8% ROE and 8.4% cost of equity). For 2018, our key assumptions include loan growth at 4% yoy, NIM at 2.5%, credit cost at 57bps and a CIR of 49%. Downside risks: NIM pressure, and deterioration in asset quality.

1023, CIMB GROUP HOLDINGS BHD ," Mon, 28 May 2018, 10:05 AM ",CIMB Group - Uplift to CET1 from Principal deal,NEWSBREAK HLIB’s VIEW,"CIMB announced the completion of realignment of ownership stakes with Principal Financial Group in its CIMB-Principal JVs across ASEAN. CIMB will book a gain of RM920m (1/3 of its is actual realised gains with remaining being revaluation gain) and improvement of 15bps in CET1 ratio which will offset the - 50bps impact on Day-1 of MFRS9 implementation. Our forecast is unchanged and we maintain our  rating with unchanged  of   (COE: 10%, WACC: 8.7%). CIMB announced the completion of realignment of ownership stakes with Principal Financial Group in its CIMB-Principal JVs across ASEAN regions. To recap, the realignment of shareholding in CIMB-Principal JVs (involving CIMB-Principal Asset Management Group and CIMB-Principal Islamic Asset Management) would result in Principal holding a 60% stake with CIMB owning the remaining 40%. The exercise will see the CIMB recording a gain of about RM920m and about 15bps increase in its Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio.  The completion of the deal is in line with management’s guidance. We are neutral on the latest announcement as the asset management division contributes stable earnings to CIMB’s Group Asset Management and Investment (GAMI) despite the challenging market environment for asset management.  CIMB will book a disposal gain of approximately RM920m (of which 1/3 of it is actual realised gain, with the remaining being revaluation gain). CET1 is expected to improve by 15bps (as at end-4Q17, CET1 stood at 12.2%), and this will be partly offset the 50bps guidance negative impact on Day-1 of MFRS9 implementation  No change to our forecast as we treat the gains as one-off.  We are optimistic that CIMB is poised to post another round of improved performance in FY18, benefitting from the tail end of its T18 strategy that ensures further earnings recovery and ROE expansion. We maintain our BUY rating with unchanged GGM based TP of RM7.90 based on (i) COE of 10% and (ii) WACC of 8.7%. Source:   - 28 May 2018"
